割手割了一道小口子
有5个6-32 standoff固定在主板上，剩一个主板固定口用塑料支架支上
固定主板和电源的 6-32 圆头螺丝不容易拧花
硬盘架很难拧下来而且不兼容Pro’skit SD-9802 philip头但支持一般的螺丝刀
sata 电源线 and sata 数据线导致ssd不能固定在机箱底部，硬盘架只支持hdd
hd接线ok,没有msg接线,有三个pwrled接头,只有两个pwrled接线,左右各一个中间没有，没有res接线
安装完电源就不能安装硬盘架了
铝制外壳很小很白很干净很结实很轻
Internal Graphics = IGFX 后无法进入UEFI，因为我只接了HIS 6670 iSilence 5 DVI，无法进入Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)，只显示白屏，按电源键睡眠唤醒后Razer Deathadder 1800工作，Razer Cynosa不工作。
没有办法不开箱情况下一键恢复默认CMOS，故开机箱挡板四个白螺丝，开电源四个黑螺丝，右手掰右边卡扣左手按电池左边让其翘起后拿下电池，过一会重新装上电池和电源和机箱挡板后开机进入UEFI默认，Internal Graphics = Auto，SATA mode selection = AHCI，AC back = Alwasy on Intel Virtualization Technology = enable后顺利进入Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)

3.3V:给主板，内存，板卡供电。
5V:给主板，硬盘和光驱的某些电路供电。
12:给CPU，显卡，硬盘和光驱的马达，各种机箱风扇供电。由于CPU和显卡占据了主机功耗的绝大部分，所以12V的输出能力决定了电源是否强壮。
-12V:现在基本用不到了。
+5VSB:待机电路。
关于USB设备，有两种方式供电，一是+5VSB，另一种是5V，两者可以通过BIOS来切换。当电脑关机时，USB键盘鼠标还亮的话，就是+5VSB供电，反之则是5V。
