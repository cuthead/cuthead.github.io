Forever Young - Demo

Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait
We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best
But expecting the worst
Would you please to drop the bomb on us?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We got no power
But we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine how we won the war?
Little fascist lady she loves you so
Following her leader
She's getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young

Someone's like water
Someone's like heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
They say that youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
Why can't I sleep while I'm thinking of you
The blood is up and burning

Bang Bang Mystery Man

You make me wait for a week for your answer
And still it is of the question kind
There you carelessly throw me a whisper
Walk away only leaving behind
The scent of mystery you wear every night
How long in the air does it linger
I thought I solved you
And locked you somehow
But I can't get the key
You stay out of my reach
Bang bang the wall
Shall I kick in the door
I bang bang the wall
Shall I kick in the door
I bang bang the wall
Shall I kick in the door
I bang bang the wall
I don't want it no more
I find myself standing in front of a shaman
Asking for answers from man with the drum
If I play loud will you fall in a trance and
Bring me back some kind of a chance
Bring me hope is my uncertainity
Give me the code to break your mystery
Bring me hope is my uncertainity
Give me the code to break your mystery
I bang bang the gong
And you dance my song
I bang bang the gong
And you dance my song
I bang bang the gong
And you dance my song
I can't wait for long,
so I bang bang the gong
The scent of mystery you wear every night
How long in the air does it linger
Not your concern, it is now my own fight
But as much as I cried you stayed
In my mind
Bang bang the wall
Shall I kick in the door
I bang bang the wall
Shall I kick in the door
I bang bang the wall
Shall I kick in the door
I bang bang the wall
I don't want it no more
I bang bang the gong
And you dance my song
I bang bang the gong
And you dance my song
I bang bang the gong
And you dance my song
I can't wait for long
So I bang bang the gong

1.Prelude(The Family Trip)

There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're going
Or which way the wind is blowing
Is it raining? Is it snowing
Is a hurricane a-blowing
Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Oh, the fires of hell are glowing
Is the grisly reaper mowing
Yes! The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!
Stop the boat!

序幕曲(家庭旅行)

无法知道世俗里的规则
我们该何去何从呢?
无法知道我们将去往何方
或是风自那里吹起的
下雨了吗!? 下雪了吗!?
这是飓风的咆哮
污点是不会曝光的
所以危机必须繁衍
Oh!地狱之火在烧灼着
这是可怕的掠夺
是啊!!所以危机必须繁衍
为了让划桨手能继续划船
他们注定不能见光
有任何使他们放慢(速度)的号志
就停下船!!

2.Cake and Sodomy

I am the god of fuck, I am the god of fuck
Virgins sold in quantity, herded by heredity
Red neck burn out mid west mind,
who said date rape isn't kind?
Porno nation, evaluation what's this time for segregation
Libido, libido fascination, too much oral defecation
White trash get down on your knees,
time for cake and sodomy
Time for cake and sodomy
(I am the god of fuck, I am the god of fuck)
VCR's and vaseline, tv-fucked by plastic queens
Cash in hand and dick on screen,
who said god was ever clean?
Bible-belt round anglio-waste,
putting sinners in their place
Yeah, right, great if you're so good explain the shit stains on
your face
White trash get down on your knees,
time for cake and sodomy
Time for cake and sodomy

蛋糕与鸡奸

我是干之神,我是干之神
处女大量贩,物以类聚
红领衫烧尽守旧的思想
谁敢说约会强暴不是来自于天性使然
在色情的领域,在这个时机来个种族隔离评价
性冲动,性欲浓烈,肉欲横流
白人废物皆拜倒在(你)你的膝下
是到了点心与鸡奸的时候了
是到了点心与鸡奸的时候了
(我是干之神,我是干之神)
(备妥)VCR和凡士林,锁码频道由塑胶皇后(自慰棒)领衔主演
手里还握着现金,就大剌剌的在萤幕上秀出自己的屌
谁说上帝永远是圣洁的!
圣经环伺着交欢后的秽物
安置所有带罪者在那地方
就是这样!非常好!假使你能充分表达那种满脸屎粒感觉的话......
白人废物皆拜倒在(你)你的膝下
是到了点心与鸡奸的时候了
是到了点心与鸡奸的时候了

3.Lunchbox

I break you!!!!!
On we plow
The big bully try to stick his finger in my chest
Try to tell me, tell me he's the best
But I don't really give a good goddamn cause
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well
I wanna grow up
I wanna be a big rock and roll star
I wanna grow up I wanna be
So no one fucks with me
I got the pencils in my pocket, try to put me down
Wanna go out, gotta get out
To the playground, gonna throw down at the playground
I wanna go out
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Pow pow pow,
pow pow pow,
pow pow pow,
pow pow pow
I wanna grow up I wanna be a big rock and roll star I wanna grow
up I wanna be
So no one fucks with me

午餐盒

我打爆你!!!!!!!!
吃我们一拳
那个大流氓用他的手指戳着我胸口
想让我知道,知道他是最屌的(家伙)
但我真的没有把他放在眼里
我拿起我的午餐盒,我早就准备给他好看了
我拿起我的午餐盒,我早就准备给他好看了
我拿起我的午餐盒,我早就准备给他好看了
我要长大
我要成为一个摇滚巨人
我要长大,我一定要
如此一来没有人敢再来惹我
我放了几只铅笔在口袋里,想制止自己
想逃走,想逃离现场
逃到了游乐场,抛下所有来到游乐场
我想逃走
下次是那一个混蛋准备吃我的拳头(武器)
下次是那一个混蛋准备吃我的拳头(武器)
下次是那一个混蛋准备吃我的拳头(武器)
Pow pow pow
pow pow pow
pow pow pow
pow pow pow
我要长大,我要成为一个摇滚巨人
我要长大,我一定要
如此一来没有人敢再来惹我

4.Organ Grinder

I am the face of piss and shit and sugar
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey
What I want, what I want is just your children
I hate what I have become to escape
what I hated being Caliopenis envy from your daddy
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear
What I say disgusts him
He wants to be me and that scares him
Lets do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey
The black keys
Here is my real head, here is my real head
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head
They try to blink me not to think me
Don't want to bring me out I am the rotten teeth,
my fists are lined with suckers
My prison skin's an eyesore mirror sketch pad
I am your son
Your dad
Your fag
Your fad
Here is my real head, here is my real head
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head

磨牙组织

我的脸上堆满着酸甜苦辣,五味杂陈
我和我那滑稽的小猴一起跳着随意的舞步
我要什么!我要的只是你的小孩
我恨为什么我曾遭受冷落
为什么我羡慕你的爸爸时心中的恨意却由然而升
你将不会听到那些他不想听到的东西
我说了什么让他讨厌了
他想扮成我的样子去吓他
来和我那滑稽的小猴一起跳着随意的舞步吧!
黑色的钥匙
我这颗头是真的,我这颗头是真的
我带着这个该死的面具,因为你管不了我
我这颗头是真的
他们只会对我视若无睹,而不是想去面对我
别想把我支开,我就是满口烂牙(危言耸听)怎样
我就是和一些烂人狼狈为奸(打交道)
我禁锢的躯壳反映着成为被除之而后快的眼中钉(该有的形貌)
我是你儿子
我是你爸
我是你的跟班
我是你的楷模
我这颗头是真的,我这颗头是真的
我带着这个该死的面具,因为你管不了我
我这颗头是真的

5.Cyclops

Cyclops woman got one eye in her head
Mascera-clotted vision she is fed
Cyclops woman can't see nothing at all
She got a pin prick spiral hole
She can't see nothing, nothing at all
She can't see nothing, nothing at all
Cyclops woman dying in her shell
Guilt got her trapped in nailed in well
Cyclops woman is the eye of the world
Who's reflection's in the retina?
She can't see nothing, nothing at all
She can't see nothing, nothing at all
Dialate, dialate

独眼巨人

独眼女巨人头上长了一个眼珠
所有的异性视她为一个不祥之物
反正独眼女巨人什么都看不见
她拿起大头钉割开一道裂口
她什么都看不见,全都看不见
她什么都看不见,全都看不见
独眼女巨人在她的躯壳里凋零了
罪孽设下陷阱擒住她并弃置于一口小井中
独眼女巨人之眼,是世界之眼
谁的影像反射在(她的)视网膜 ?
她什么都看不见,全都看不见
她什么都看不见,全都看不见
Dialate, dialate .....

6.Dope Hat

I peek into the hole, I struggle for control
The children love the show,
but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes
I scratch around the brim, I let my mind give in
The crowd begins to grin,
but they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy,
but we all know the hat is wearing me
My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that
My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise
Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes
They will bite the hand if it is slower than
the quickness of their scrutinizing eyes
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy,
but we all know the hat is wearing me
Chicanery will always make you happy,
but we all know the hat is wearing me

戏帽

我朝那洞里窥伺,我努力去克制
小孩子们爱这个秀
但是他们不敢直视我绝望的眼神
不敢直视我绝望的眼神
我搔弄着(帽)缘,我让我思绪投入其中
观众们开始笑
但是当我双眼一沉,他们就忍不住尖叫起来,这是预料之中的事
不忍卒睹这个悲剧,转化它成为魔术
我最压轴的戏法,将永远让你们快乐
但我们都明白是那帽子戴(掌控)着我
我的戏法就是在这帽子里,里头装满着一堆有的没的
我的视线渐渐错乱,那兔子竟是一只猴子乔装的
星星,药品和针头就在我们眼前起舞
假如它们的动作比眼尖的他们(观众)还慢时,它们将会紧抓住彼此的手
不忍卒睹这悲剧,转化它成为魔术
我最压轴的戏法,将永远让你们快乐
但我们都明白是那帽子戴(掌控)着我
障眼法将永远让你们快乐
但我们都明白是那帽子戴(掌控)着我

7.Get Your Gunn

Goddamn your righteous hand
I eat innocent meat
The housewife I will beat
The prolife I will kill
What you don't do I will
I bash myself to sleep
What you sow I will reap
I scar myself you see
I wish I wasn't me
I am the little stick
You stir me into shit
I hate therefore I am
Goddamn your rightous hand
Goddamn, goddamn Goddamn, goddamn
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgements
And goodguy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me
I throw a little fit I slit my teenage wrist
The most that I can learn
Is in records that you burn
Get your gunn, get your gunn get your gunn, get your gunn
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgements
And goodguy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me
I am the VHS
Record me with your fist
You want me to save the world I'm just a little girl
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgements
And goodguy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me
Get your gunn, get your gunn Get your gunn, get your gunn...
Get!

带种一点

你那该死的正义之手
我要大啖你清白无邪的肉
还有那家庭主妇,我也要通通轰出去
我会掩灭掉所有证据
我专挑你没种去干的事去做
我敲昏自己好睡去
你来种树我来乘凉(你来播种,我来收割)
你看到我自残
我希望我不是我
我是一个杂碎
你们把我和屎搅和在一块
我恨我因此(变成)这样
你那该死的正义之手
该死的, 该死的! 该死的, 该死的!
虚伪的道德伦理运作的很好
脱口秀是给那些意志薄弱的人用的
可是你们的偏见和那好人好事的勋章
别想企图给我一个教训
我自暴自弃,我自毁前程
我最多能学的
是混迹在你烧录的唱片里
带种一点!!带种一点!!带种一点!!带种一点!!
虚伪的道德伦理运作的很好
脱口秀是给那些意志薄弱的人用的
可是你们的偏见和那好人好事的勋章
别想企图给我一个教训
我是那VHS
录下了我和你们拳头的合影
你们祈望我去拯救这个世界,我只是一个小女孩
虚伪的道德伦理运作的很好
脱口秀是给那些意志薄弱的人用的
可是你们的偏见和那好人好事的勋章
别想企图给我一个教训
带种一点!!带种一点!!带种一点!!带种一点!!
来吧!

8.Wrapped in Plastic

Guilt is a snake we beat with a rake
To grow in our kitchen in the pies we bake
Feed it to us to squirm in our bellies
Twisting our guts make our spines to jelly
Stay, don't want to go now
Drove the children from their chores
Handcrafted housewives into whores
Fear of the beast is calling it near
Creating what we're hating, it's only fear that is here
Stay, don't want to go now
Come into our home, won't you stay?
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic
Come into our home, won't you stay?
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic
I'm only as deep as the self that I dig
I'm only as sick as the stick in the pig
Thin and so white, thin and so white
Daddy tells the daughter
While mommy's sleeping at night
To wash away sin you must take off your skin
The righteous father wears the yellowest grin
Don't wanna go now
Stay, don't wanna go now, stay, don't wanna go now
Come into our home, won't you stay?
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic

包在塑胶袋里

罪孽如同一只蛇,我们拿起耙子就想击退它
滋长(速度)如同我们在厨房里烘焙的水果派
把它加诸在我们(体内)在我们的身体中蠕动窜流
挤扭我们的肠子旋转制成果冻
留下!那都别想去
执行他们例行运载儿童的任务
纯手工制造良家妇女成为妓女
混蛋的恐惧已经步步逼近
制造我们所恨之入骨的东西,唯一怕的是它就在这儿
留下!那都别想去
进来我家,你不想留下吗?
我知道牛排已经凉了,可是这有用塑胶袋包着呀
进来我家,你不想留下吗?
我知道牛排已经凉了,可是这有用塑胶袋包着呀
我只不过是钻牛角尖
我只不过是病入膏肓
既单薄又苍白,既单薄又苍白
爸爸告诉女儿
一但妈咪晚上睡觉时
(就去)洗刷罪孽,你必须脱一层皮
那正派的神父露出一脸最黄的微笑
现在不动身吗?
留下!那都别想去,留下!那都别想去
我知道牛排已经凉了,可是这有用塑胶袋包着呀

9.Dogma

Burn the witches, burn the witches,
don't take time to sew your stiches
Burn the witches, burn the witches
Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor
You cannot sedate all the things you hate
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges,
don't take time to sew your stiches
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges
Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor
I don't need your hate, I decide my fate
You cannot sedate all the things you rape

教条

烧死女巫,烧死女巫
别花时间在缝补你造的诗句
烧死女巫,烧死女巫
善良是你遵行的行为,邪恶是你灵魂的本性
你不能把所有心头之恨压抑下来
烧死你的桥(?),烧死你的桥(?)
善良是你遵行的行为,邪恶是你灵魂的本性
我不需要你的恨,我自己的命运自己决定
你不能把所有暴力倾向压抑下来

10.Sweet Tooth

Her heart shivers in my hand
She's melting on me like cotton candy
I make the faces that make you cry
I want you more when you're afraid of
My disease, disease is draining me
Anymore you're not so 'pretty please'
Disease, disease is draining me
I want you more when you're afraid of me
I will break you inside out
You are mine, you are mine
I will break you inside out
You are mine, you are mine
Her hair hangs in swollen strings
I'm choking on her, it feels so sickening
I make the faces that make you cry
I want you more when you're afraid of
My disease, disease is draining me
Anymore you're not so pretty, please
Disease, disease is draining me
I want you more when you're afraid of me
I will break you inside out
You are mine, you are mine

甜牙

她的心脏在我的手中颤抖着
她正如同棉花糖一样溶解在我之中
我摆出一个会让你哭泣的表情
我要你更加地对我的病态感到害怕,这病态已经淹没我
如今你真的已不再是那么"天生美丽"
病态,这病态已经淹没我
我要你更加地对我感到害怕
我将要完全地击溃你
你是我的,你是我的
我将要完全地击溃你
你是我的,你是我的
她如飞瀑般的发丝出奇的柔顺
我把她堵塞住 ,这感觉真是恶心极了
我摆出一个会让你哭泣的表情
我要你更加地对我的病态感到害怕,这病态已经淹没我
如今你真的已不再是那么"天生美丽"
病态,这病态已经淹没我
我要你更加地对我感到害怕
我将要完全地击溃你
你是我的,你是我的

11.Snake Eyes and Sissies(蛇眼和娘娘腔)

Wrench is just a household God
but I carry mine with pride
I don't work but I can work with it to split your smile
Run you down without a twitch,
your car's just not as big as mine
Tear the son out of your bitch and
sprinkle your remains with lime
I ain't no workin' man,
I do the best I can,
I got the devil's hand
Rollin' sixes
I am the habit man,
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand
My afternoon's remote control
Daydream milk and genocide
Tranquility with broken knees, silly putty enemies
Butter knife in your side
What I got I got for free, middle finger technology
What's yours is mine, yours is mine,
told you fucker, yours is mine
Snake eyes for sissies
I ain't no workin' man,
I do the best I can,
I got the devil's hand
Rollin' sixes
I am the habit man,
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand
I am the pedophlle's dream
A messianic Peter Pan
Just a boy, just a boy, just a little fucking boy,
I can never be a man
I ain't no workin' man,
I do the best I can,
I got the devil's hand
Rollin' sixes
I am the habit man,
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand
I ain't no workin' man,
I do the best I can,
I got the devil's hand
I am the habit man,
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand
(Oh no, Oh no)

12.My Monkey(我的猴子)

I had a little monkey
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo
And now my monkey's dead
At least he looks that way, but then again don't we all
(what I make is what I am, I can't be forever)
I had a little a monkey I sent him to the country and I fed him on
gingerbread
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo
And now my monkey's dead
Poor little monkey
'Make you...break you...make you...break you...lookout'
(what I make is what I am, I can't live forever)
We are our own wicked gods
With little g's and big dicks
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise
I had a little a monkey I sent him to the country and I fed him on
gingerbread
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo
And now my monkey's dead
The primate's scream of consonance is a reflection
Of his own mind's dissonance

13.Misery Machine(苦难机器)

Man in the front got a sinister grin, careen down highway 666
We wanna go, crush the slow, as the pitchfork bends the
needles grow
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement
We're gonna ride to the abbey of the ema, to the abbey of the
ema
Blood is pavement
The grill in the front is my sinister grin, bugs in my teeth make
me sick sick sick
The objects may be larger than they appear in the mirror
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement

We're gonna ride to the abbey of the ema, to the abbey of the
ema
Blood is pavement
When you ride you're ridden, when you ride you're ridden
I am fueled by filth and fury
Do what I will, I will hurry there, there
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement

Blood is pavement

2.I Put a Spell on You

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine.
I can't stand the things that you do.
No, no, no, I ain't lyin'.
No.
I don't care if you don't want me
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.
Yeah, I'm yours, yours, yours.
I love you. I love you. (Repeat Three Times)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah....
I put a spell on you.
Lord! Lord! Lord! ...
.'Cause you're mine, yeah.
I can't stand the things that you do
When you're foolin' around.
I don't care if you don't want me.
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.
Yeah, yours, yours, yours!
I can't stand your foolin' around.
If I can't have you,
No one will!
I love you, you, you! I love you. I love you. I love you!
I love you, you, you!
I don't care if you don't want me.
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.

3.White Trash
(Remixed by Tony F. Wiggins)

Virgins sold in quantity,
African-American heredity.
I'm playin' my guitar and I'm feelin' fine.
Why are all the niggers in the unemployment line?
(Chorus: White Trash get down on your knees;
Time for cake and sodomy.
White Trash get down on your knees;
Time for cake and sodomy.)
Teenage girl, a teenage queen;
'Til she's on video -- A PORNO queen!
She likes to give head.
She likes it mean.
That's why she's my little queen.
(Chorus)
Yeah....
White boy tryin' to get some behind:
"Who says date rape isn't kind?"
Who's he gonna goad?
Who's he gonna please?
It don't matter,
As long as she's on her knees.
(Chorus)

白色垃圾(白人废物)

处女大量被贩卖, 非裔美国人的遗传(宿命)
我玩着我的吉他,我感到很舒坦
为何所有的黑鬼都是无业游民?(白人废物让你抬不起头来;又到了点心和鸡奸的时间了)
青少女,青少女皇后; 直到她上了电视--(变成)一个色情皇后!
她想增长智慧,她希望一切中庸
这就是为何她是我的小女皇
Yeah!!.....白人小子想捡便宜: "谁说约会强暴不是一种仁慈?"
谁将是他要唆使的人?
谁将是他要讨好的人?
这都无所谓, 没多久她就屈服了

4.Rock 'n' Roll Nigger

And the world spreads its legs....
And the world spreads its legs
For another fuckin' star!
'Cause I AM the all-american Antichrist.
I was made in america,
And america hates ME for what I am.
I am YOUR shit.
You should be ashamed of what you have eaten.
I'm a rock &amp; roll nigger!
Baby was a black sheep.
Baby was a whore.
Baby's gotten big,
And baby's getting bigger.
Baby got somethin'.
Baby want more.
Baby, baby, baby was a rock &amp; roll nigger.
How do you like the world around you?
Do you like what you see?
How do you like the world around you?
Ready to be....
(Chorus: Outside of society,
Waiting for me.
Outside of society
Is where I wanna be.)
Baby was a black sheep.
Baby was a whore.
Baby got big,
And baby's getting bigger.
Baby got a gun,
Got her finger on the trigger.
Baby, baby, baby was a rock &amp; roll nigger.
(Chorus) Nigger. Rock &amp; roll nigger.
I'm a rock &amp; roll nigger.
This is your world in which we grow,
And we will grow to hate you.
We will grow to hate you.
We will grow.
We will grow.
We will grow to hate you.
We will grow.
We will grow.
We will grow to hate you.
1-2-3-4!
I was lost in the valley of pleasure.
I was lost in the infinite sea.
I was lost and begging for pleasure.
And this world is waiting for me.
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger.
Jesus Christ and grandma, too.
Brian Warner (what a nigger!)
Nigger, nigger, nigger nigger nigger!
(Chorus Twice)
Yeah! Yeah! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
FUCK YOU!

摇滚黑鬼

全世界扳开它的双脚......全世界扳开它的双脚
献给另一个该死的明星
因为我是彻头彻尾的美国反基督
我生于美国, 美国因为我是这种人而恨我
我是你们的眼中钉
你们该为你们曾吃过的东西感到羞耻
我是一个摇滚黑鬼!!!
宝贝是一只黑色绵羊, 宝贝是一个妓女, 宝贝的那个好了不起, 宝贝的那个渐渐大了

我们将会长大,我们将会长大,我们将会长大来恨你
1-2-3-4
我迷失在消遥谷里

Irresponsible Hate Anthem 无责任憎恨圣歌 (update:11/11)
我是典型的美国人, 我要诱骗你去自杀.
我是极端主义份子, 我眼中透露着我未实现的理想
我有仇必报!!!我以暴制暴!!!!!我是一头脱缰的野兽!!
FUCK IT!!!!
嘿~~!无辜的受害者(基督徒),我要再一次玷辱你的双眼!
嘿~~!无辜的受害者(基督徒), 是你们逼我这么做的!
我就是真理,我是憎恨的化身
我这就去杀光所有的人!看你们的神如何分辨(谁是基督徒)!!
FUCK IT!!!!!
人心惶惶/你我心知肚明
我不是在令人唾骂下诞生的, 我不需要去找一个靠山
我最好,最好,最好,最好别说出来!!这最好,最好,最好,最好别说出去!!
我有仇必报!!!我以暴制暴!!!!!
我不是一个迷失自己的白痴!!
FUCK IT!!!!!

I am so all-american, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself
fuck it
Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim,
you were the one who put the stick in my hand
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out
fuck it
Everybody's someone else's nigger/I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers/
I don't need to choose a side
I better, better, better, better not say this
better, better, better, better not tell
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself
fuck it
(chorus)

The Beautiful People 美丽的人们 (update:11/12)
我不需要你们, 也不稀罕你们!
别在作无谓的抵抗, 我将要征讨你们
这不是你们的错! 因为你们从没有对过!
看那弱者正在装腔作势,.....
美丽的人们!! 美丽的人们!!
这完全端看你们自己有多少份量
你们看不见自己盘踞之树外的森林; 你们也闻不到自己拉在裤管中的屎
嘿~~!你们看到了什么!? 某些美好的事!? 还是某些自由!?
嘿~~!你们想返璞归真吗!? 如果你们一直和衣冠禽兽住在一起, 那将永无宁日的!
没有时间去辨识, 像你们一样的混蛋(motherfucker )全部都让我忿恨!!
虫卵将寄生在每一个圣体(host)中, 很难挑出那个是被它们吃掉最多的一个!
可怕的人们!!可怕的人们!!
这好比拆穿你们自己有多少份量
资本主义就是这样产生的!
旧体制的法西斯主义将会铲除它的!

I don't want you and I don't need you
don't bother to resist, I'll beat you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
the weak ones are there to justify the strong
the beautiful people, the beautiful people
it's all relative to the size of your steeple
you can't see the forest for the trees
you can't smell
your own shit on your knees
Hey you, what do you see?
something beautiful, something free?
hey you, are you trying to be mean?
if you live with apes man, it's hard to be clean
there's no time to discriminate,
hate every motherfucker
that's in your way
the worms will live in every host
it's hard to pick which one they eat most
the horrible people, the horrible people
it's as anatomic as the size of your steeple
capitalism has made it this way,
old-fashioned fascism
will take it away
(chorus)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World 乾涸, 窒碍, 死亡降临(update:11/13)
你砍下了全部的指头, 用来偿还所有的帐单
在用一些蛋糕来裹住, 掩饰那些轮廓
醒醒吧! 别再晃了! 因为你只是在浪费时间
你不想要再来一些吗!? 你不需要再来一些吗!?
你得到但却不是真的拥有; 你占有却不能真正支配
挑起在你心中的微小的意识, 披上你堕落的绳索
你不曾读过你自己写的东西(你不曾勇敢面对自己)
我将成为你的爱人, 永远相随
我将是明天, 最后我将无所不能
你不想要再来一些吗!? 你不需要再来一些吗!?
你拨开头发到我的喉咙上, 我能感觉到你手指进入我的体内
扯下原罪苦果的约束, 披上你堕落的外衣
现在你必须吐掉那(苦果的)种子
全部乾涸!! 永远笼罩!! 完全灭绝, 然后死亡降临..........

you cut off all of your fingers
trade them in for dollar bills
cake on some more make-up to
cover up all those lines
wake up and stop shaking
don't you want some of this?
don't you need some of this?
you take but cannot be given
you ride but cannot be ridden
pinch this tiny heart of mine
wrap it up in soiled twine
you never read what you've written
I'll be your lover, i'll be forever
i'll be tomorrow, i am anything when i'm high
don't you want some of this?
don't you need some of this?
you shove your hair down my throat
i feel your fingers in me
tear this bitter fruit to mess
and wrap it in your soiled dress
now you must spit out the seeds
(chorus)
all dried up and tied up forever
all fucked up and dead to the world...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tourniquet 止血带 (update:11/14)
她是由毛发,骨头, 小牙, 还有一些我形容不出的东西构成的.
她像个跛子用的玩意, 朝这靠过来了, 脊椎只靠一根细绳支撑着
我完全把我们的爱缠绕在这个替代物上, 用银箔绑的像蜘蛛脚一样
我从未想到她终究会腐烂, 但苍蝇将永远在那下蛋
拿掉你对我的憎恨, 你的痛苦牺牲算我一份
你们至使至终都不相信我, 我是你们的止血带!
义肢与苍蝇结构的混合体
紧密的编织带来剧痛
请尽管告诉我你的痛苦
守护那份最后的纯真
我从未想要这样的结果, 但苍蝇将永远在那下蛋

she's made of hair and bone and little teeth
and things I cannot speak
she comes on like a crippled plaything
spine is just a string
I wrapped our love in all this foil
silver-tight like spider legs
I never wanted it to ever spoil
but flies will always lay their eggs
Take your hatred out on me
make your victim my head
you never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet
prosthetic synthesis with butterfly
sealed up with virgin stitch
if it hurts, just tell me
preserve the innocence
I never wanted it to end this way
but flies will lay their eggs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Horn 小尖角 (敝护所) (update:12/05)
这有一颗苹果塞在我的私处, 现在我是一个大妓女
这有一颗毒瘤藏在电视机里, 在它漫延前要烧死它
某些人最好先找一只狗来出气, 八卦电台将会封锁消息并保持沉默
逃离这无底深渊来到这个小尖角
"小尖角已经诞生了!"
世界扳开它的双脚献给另一个明星;世界展示它的脸庞献给另一次创伤
死神将会为所谓的改革舞蹈;虫体们将会奄奄一息的等待着
"你的盲目换得现在我的耳聋",所以请对小尖角默念:
"拯救你自己逃离这些....."
所有人将遭劫难.....
"你不能拯救你自己的......."

there's an apple in the pussy mouth
now I am the dinner whore
there's a tumor in the t.v. mouth
burn it out before it grows
someone better get the dog to kick,
jaws wired shut to save the dick
out of the bottomless pit comes the little horn
"little horn is born"
the world spreads its legs for another star
world shows its face for another scar
dead will dance for what is left
the worms will wait with baited breath
"your blind have now become my deaf"
so says this little horn
"save yourself from this..."
(chorus)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cryptorchild 隐睾症者 (update:12/05)
每一次我让母亲伤心落泪时, 一只天使就会自天堂陨落
当一个小男孩仍然是一只虫体时, 是非常难去学习数字"7"(7种原罪)
但是当他们责备你时, 这些是他们首先做的事情
每一次我看着外面, 我母亲死去, 我感觉我背部的形状正在改变
当虫体耗尽, 男孩从未考虑要去掠夺
当他们责备你时, 扎一下你的手指头就好了!......
月亮曾吞蚀着太阳.......
天使曾展开双翅......
时间曾为悲伤到来......

Each time i make my mother cry an
angel dies and falls from heaven
when the boy is still a worm it's hard to
learn the number seven
but when they get to you
it's the first thing that they do
each time I look outside
my mother dies, I feel my back is changing shape
when the worm consumes the boy it's never
considered rape
when they get to you
prick your finger it is done...
the moon has now eclipsed the sun...
the angel has spread its wings...
the time has come for bitter things...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defamography 无所不在 (update:12/09)
当你希望自己像个明星时, 就别让自己堕落, 堕落太艰难了
你我合而为一, 我毫无保留
一只昆虫死在你的圈套中
我蠕进了你的体内,现在我蜇伏在你的内脏里,
你我合而为一, 现在我在一条秘轨里
"我把捧你像是个最甜蜜的天使, 我却将要把你糟蹋成一个妓女
我将会把你的神淹没在我的虫液体沫里, 你将会在你的A书中瓦解变形"
摇滚明星!!yeah!(你是如此的污秽,肮脏)
你吞噬了我的身心, 你的光芒是如此的耀眼
留给我一个残破不堪的伤口
我让自己生病只是为了是要毒死你, 我不能得到你的话,别人也休想....
你是我的人, 却又那么不真实
我是如此污秽肮脏的摇滚明星!!yeah!你是我的人, 却又那么不真实......

when you wish upon a star
don't let yourself fall, fall in too hard
I fell into you and I'm on my back
an insect decaying in your little trap
I squirm into you, now I'm in your gut
I fell into you, now I'm in a rut
"i lift you up like the sweetest angel,
i'll tear you down like a whore.
i will bury your god in my warm spit,
you'll be deformed in your porn"
rock star, yeah (you're such a dirty, dirty)
rock star, yeah (dirty, dirty, dirty)
you eat up my heart and all the little parts
your star is so sharp
it leaves me jagged holes
I make myself sick just to poison you
if I can't have you then no one will
(chorus)
you are the one i want and what i want is so unreal
i'm such a dirty Rock star yeah...
(i am the one you want and the one you want is so unreal)

Wormboy 虫男 (update:12/16)
何时你才会明白你已经存在(于现世中)?
所以在被洗脑后, 你的感官变得低俗
"(神)爱世人"毁灭了一切让我曾被(世人)恨到无地自容的价值,
我知道我被赦免了!
我知道我被赦免了.....
哦!不要! 这就是他们所要说的一切!
哦!不要! 我不要任人宰割!
当你到了天堂, 你才会希望自己在地狱
何时你才会明白, 你已经存在(于天堂中)?
到时你会感谢我,曾经带你历过这些
不要揭这疮疤, 除非你不想复原了
这世界令人毛骨悚然如同虫体长出翅膀一样
现在我拥有了自己的翅膀, 我永远不得而知了
当我是一个虫体, 我想我不会想要经历这些

when will realize you're already there?
so watered down-your feelings have turned to mud.
"love everybody" is destroying the value of
all hate has got me nowhere
I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping away
oh no, it is everything they said it was
oh no, I am everything they said I was
when you you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell
when will you realize, you're already here
you'll think us now that you have crossed over
don't pick the scabs or you will never heal
the world shudders as the worm gets its wings
(chorus)
then i got my wings and i never even knew it
when i was a worm, thought i wouldn't get through it...

Angel With the Scabbed Wings 折翼天使 (update:12/23)
他是只折翼的天使, 一脸毒瘾发作的样子, 急需吸些(毒)粉
他将辣手摧花, 用他对摇滚的痛楚去榨乾所有的子宫
死神
就是他, 他为所欲为, 做那些令你们不忍卒赌的事, 扮那些你们现在不愿面对的样子
(他)描绘出一个小钥匙孔, 窥伺那些玻璃(表里不一)的人
你们不想要变成他; 你们只想见到他
妈咪拿出一只稻草人, 好让玉米能够长成
(但)人怎么栽不一定怎么获
"他是制造者"(他是取得者)
"他是救世主"(他是掠夺者)
回来吧!你们将永远不会离开他
回来吧!你们将永远会喜爱他.....

he is the angel with the scabbed wings
hard-drug face, want to powder his nose
he will deflower the freshest crop
dry up all the wombswith his rock and roll sores
dead
is what he is, he does what he please
the things that he has you'll never want to see
what you're never gonna be now
sketch a little keyhole for looking-glass people
you don't want to be him
you only want to see him
mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow
man can't always reap what he sow
"he is the maker"
(he is the taker)
"he is the saviour"
(he is the raper)
(verse 2)
(chorus)
get back you're never gonna leave him
get back you're always gonna please him

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kinderfeld 窨暗温床 (update:01/07)
他住在我的嘴里,并告诉我该说什么
当他滔滔不绝,他可以颠倒是非
双手脆裂,肮脏,钉子钉在那双翅膀里
当他滔滔不绝, 他解开所有疑惑
虫说:"告诉我一些美好的事,告诉我一些自由的事,告诉我一些美好的事, 一些我渴望的事"
然后我得到一双翅膀, 我全然不知它的存在, 当我是一只虫时,我想我无法体悟这些
Jack:来吧,来吧......
所有的玩具都有一股孩子气, 长癣的膝盖将服从(于他)
我将只是必须跪在帚柄上,只是为了让他离去
(虫的就职典礼)
然后我得到一双翅膀, 我完全不知道它的存在, 当我是一只虫时,我想我无法体悟这些
一个我们还不曾听过的声音:"因为今天是绝望的,时光不会再重来/
因为你的谎言淹曾没了我, 我变成了最强悍的害虫" 害虫.....
经由Jack的双眼: 这有打破铁规的味道
在皮带上有3个洞,断裂且肿胀的, 年代已经显露出来
男孩:"这里没有人拯救我们自己"
打破铁规的人给他自己) 这就是你该害怕的, 你(自己)就是你害怕的人

he lives inside my mouth
and tells me what to say
when he turns the trains
on he makes it go away
the hands are cracked and dirty and
the nails are beetle wings
when he turns the trains on he
unties all of the strings
The worm: "tell me something beautiful,
tell me something free,
tell me something beautiful
and i wish that i could be."
(then i got my wings and i never even knew it,
when i was a worm, thought i couldn't get through )
Jack: (not spoken) come, come
the toys all smell like children
and scab-knees will obey
i'll just have to kneel on broomsticks
just to make it go away
[the inauguration of the worm]
(then i got my wings and i never even knew it,
when i was a worm, thought i couldn't get through it)
voice we have not yet heard: "because today
is black/because there is no turning back.
because your lies have watered me/
i have become the strongest weed" weed...
through jack's eyes:
the taste of metal
disintegrator
three holes upon the leather belt
it's cut and swollen
and the age is swollen
boy: " there's no one here to save ourself."
the disintegrator: (to himself)
this is what you should fear
you are what you should fear

Antichrist Superstar 反基督的超级明星 (离经叛道) (update:01/07)
你带着你祈望的地狱来提拔我,我没有必要和你打交道
你投注你的金钱在那些无聊的事上
你只是盲目的照着他们告诉你的去做
悔悟吧!!!!这就是我要说的
我脱掉一层皮去迎合那些骗子
悔悟吧!!!!这就是我要说的
这些是无法避免的错误吗!
砍下脑袋,重生艰难
我是难以根除的祸害,现在你们将看到你们的明星
扎你的手指头, 这是完结了!
现在月亮吞噬了太阳
天使展开他们的翅膀
时间为痛苦而到来
时间已经到来,十分明确
我们的反基督几乎就在这儿了.....这是完结了!

you built me up with your wishing hell
I didn't have to sell you
you threw your money in the pissing well
you do just what they tell you
REPENT, that's what I'm talking about
i shed the skin to feed the fake
REPENT, that's what I'm talking about
whose mistake am i anyway?
Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the hydra
now you'll see your star
prick your finger it is done
the moon has now eclipsed the sun
the angel has spread its wings
the time has come for bitter things (chorus)
the time has come it is quite clear
our antichrist
is almost here...
it is done

The Minute of Decay 衰亡的瞬间 (update:01/0
没有太多的决心去爱
今天连去恨的力气也没有了
我感到一无所有, 我感觉到衰亡的瞬间
我现在正走向自我毁灭之路,我要带你一起走
我现在正走向自我毁灭之路
我现在正走向自我毁灭之路,我要带你一起走
我现在正走向自我毁灭之路
出生的刹那,已经开始走向死亡
我要足以(让我)屈服的爱
我要足以(让我)活在这谎言的爱
我洗心革面, 我从新做人
缺少痛苦,缺少希望,缺少任何能说的事情....
那是无法愈合的伤口
我现在正走向自我毁灭之路
眺望前方,我看见一个死亡世界
我想我也(和这世界)一样吧!
我现在正走向自我毁灭之路,我要带你一起走

there's not much left to love
tootired today to hate
I feel the empty
I feel the minute of decay
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me I'm on my
way down
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
the minute that it's born
it begins to die
I'd love to just give in,
I'd love to live this lie
I've been to black and back
I've whited out my name
a lack of pain, a lack of hope,
a lack of anything to say
there is no cure for what is killing me
I'm on my way down
I've looked ahead and saw a
world that's dead
I guess that I am too
(chorus)
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me...

The Reflecting God 幻像神影 (update:01/0
你的世界是个烟灰缸, 我们如同烟草般的卷起燃烧
你伤心你的残屑变成毫无价值的东西
这是吸血鬼的天性, 无邪般的欺骗
你只有逆来顺受的过
(而)我的世界是真摰不做作的,这里有一个出口
我说这就是了,错不了!
有一个梦中梦, 我在睡眠中但意识却非常清楚
当我死去时你就会明白
我梦到我见到了上帝,并且看到了我自己
明白天堂和地狱是个骗局
当我是上帝,每个人都(难逃)死亡
伤痛啊~!你能感受到我的力量吗?
穿越这里,世界就在股掌之间
伤痛啊~!伤痛啊~!你能感受到我的力量吗?
一颗子弹,世界就在股掌之间
挥舞着锋利的剑刃, 砍下我们的笑容,只剩下死亡的胁迫
没有理由活存下去呀!
(而)我的世界是真摰不做作的,这里有一个出口
我说这就是了,错不了!
有一个梦中梦, 我在睡眠中但意识却非常清楚
当我死去时你就会明白
你所见的每件我所做的事,都是由我的死亡换取的呀!
冲啊~!冲啊~!冲啊~!motherfucker!!!!!
没有救世!!没有饶恕!!
"这是基于你自己的经验而来"
饶恕!!!!!!!

your world is an ashtray
we burn and coil like cigarettes
the more you cry your ashes turn to mud
it's the nature of the leeches, the virgin's
feeling cheated
you've only spent a second of your life
my world is unaffected, there is an exit here
I say it is and then it's true,
there is a dream inside a dream,
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
you'll understand when I'm dead
I went to god just to see, and I was looking at me
saw heaven and hell were lies
when I'm god everybody dies
scar/can you feel my power?
shoot here and the world gets smaller
scar/scar/can you feel my power?
one shot and the world gets smaller
let's jump upon the sharp swords
and cut away our smiles
without the threat of death
there's no reason to live at all
my world is unaffected, there is an exit here
I say it is and then it's true,
there is a dream inside a dream,
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
you'll understand when I'm dead
(bridge)
(chorus)
"each thing i show you is a piece of my death"
shoot shoot shoot motherfucker
no salvation, no forgiveness
"this is beyond your experience"
forgiveness...

Man That You Fear 敬畏之人 (update:01/09)
蚂蚁成群的在糖里
肌肉萎缩
我们在另外一面, 萤幕是我们, 我们是电视
公开展示我
黏在我尖削的肋骨上的全是你们在流产贮藏箱内的死婴
我生在这种每况愈下的处境
那个你爱的男孩也是你所敬畏之人
祈祷吧!直到(上帝)昭唤你
长眠于所有你的痛苦
你的苹果也曾腐败过
死亡在明天到来
我完全明白,但我别无选择, 但是...
我将要所有人付出代价
你将会明白你现在就可以杀死你自己
因为在我心里你早已死亡
那个你爱的男孩也是你所敬畏之人
不理会别人眼光, 爬进黑暗里
你毒害了你所有的孩子来掩饰你的创伤
向芒刺祷告吧! 向你的恐惧祷告吧!
祈祷你的生命只是一场幻梦
一场永不复原的伤痛
现在就祷告!宝贝!
祈祷你的生命只是一场幻梦(我对于我无法洗脱的罪恶内心感到非常的纠结)
掐掉头颅,向草介般的践踏我
必须有人走向此路
我生在这种每况愈下的处境
那个你爱的男孩也是你所敬畏之人
不理会别人眼光, 爬进黑暗里
你毒害了你所有的孩子来掩饰你的创伤
向芒刺祷告吧! 向你的恐惧祷告吧!
祈祷你的生命只是一场幻梦
一场永不复原的伤痛
现在就祷告!宝贝!
祈祷你的生命只是一场幻梦
在我手上的世界,
没有人不会倾听你的悲鸣
(也)没有人会离你而去......

the ants are in the sugar
the muscles atrophied
we're on the other side, the screen is us and we're t.v.
spread me open,
sticking to my pointy ribs
are all your infants in abortion cribs
I was born into this
everything turns to shit
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear
pray until your number,
asleep from all your pain,
your apple has been rotting
tomorrow's turned up dead
i have it all and i have no choice but to
i'll make everyone pay and you will see
you can kill yourself now
because you're dead
in my mind
the boy that you loved is the monster you fear
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,
you've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
pray your life was just a dream
the cut that never heals
pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream
(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)
pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed
someone had to go this far
I was born into this
everything turns to shit
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,
you've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
pray your life was just a dream
the cut that never heals
pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream
the world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream
there's no one left for you

Track 99 无题 (update:01/10)
继续和死亡的救世主约定
我们可以挖另一个坟地
这是对你的召唤,假如你能听见这声音
我也无能为力
某种东西即将从我的胸口破膛而出
我曾见过它
它坚实且冷酷
它曾经蛰伏多年
我们要拯救你,我来此为了拯救你
这是你应得的,这是我们应得的
这是某些源自于我们自身的东西
我们不是牺牲者, 你不是牺牲者,
我们不是牺牲者, 你不是牺牲者.....
上帝将会在我面前摇尾乞怜
上帝将会臣服于我的脚下
这是时代, 时代是....当你遭逢痛苦,瞭解到是我遗弃了你

Go ahead (somethingerother) and date a dead messiah
We can dig another grave.
This is your calling
If you are hearing this, there is nothing I can do
Something has grown out of my chest.
I have seen it.
It is hard and cold.
It has been dormant for many years.
We are trying to save you, I have come to save you
This is what you deserve,
this is what we deserve
This is something we have brought upon ourselves.
We are not a victim, you are not a victim
we are not a victim, you are not a victim
God will grovel before me
God will crawl at my feet.
And the time is this
And the time is...
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you...

Great Big White World (伟大的大白人世界) (10/20 update)
在遥远的宇宙深处,他们的光茫璀璨的就像个独立于世的乐园,
我梦到我是一个太空人, 那地方让我就像只蛾扑向那烈火熊熊般地吸引着我.
于是, 我们过去的世界都去他妈的消失了!
但可笑的是,我发现不附属于你们的世界
草木不生,一片死寂
因为.....这是一个伟大的大白人世界,我将渐渐凋零褪色.....
因为我们总是只爱我们自己,我们总是只爱另外一个人.....
在所有我炽烈的欲火,
我平凡的想法中,
只愿你是那只皇后,只为了你活到今天,
除了这之外,我还能乞求什么呢?
因为.....这是一个伟大的大白人世界!
现在仿佛在地狱的寒冷,使所有的血脉都脆裂了,
而手上的玫瑰,也将我的手给扯破了........
圣母玛利亚已经胎死腹中!
我们却还要像只虫般愚蠢地祈祷着
大白人世界就是如此的丑陋!
这是一个伟大的大白人世界,我将渐渐凋零褪色.....,
因为我们总是只爱我们自己,我们总是只爱另外一个人.....
在所有我炽烈的欲火,
我平凡的想法中,
只愿你是那只皇后,只为了你活到今天,
除了这之外,我还能乞求什么呢?

In space the stars are no nearer
They just glitter like a morgue
And I dreamed I was a spaceman
Burned like a moth in a flame
And our world was so fucking gone
But I'm not attached to your world
Nothing heals and nothing grows

Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves,
We used to love one another
All my stitches itch
My prescription's low, I wish you
Were Queen
Just for today
In a world so white what else could I say?

And hell was so cold
All the vases are so broken
And the roses tear our hands all open
Mother Mary miscarry
But we pray just like insects
The world is so ugly now
Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves,
We used to love one another
All my stitches itch
My prescription's low, I wish you
Were Queen
Just for today
In a world so white what else could I say?

The Dope Show (麻药秀) (10/22 update)
麻药它们说: 要让我们四肢无力.
而我们刚好就是喜欢沉沦于那空虚感,自我陶醉和肤浅下流之中.
忍受着条子和男同性恋者们想和我们胡搞,
(让我们)恨死今天, 也放弃明天.....
在这场麻药秀中,你我都是主角.
放眼望去,处处充满了绮丽诱人的美妙东西,
它们却都会在你们一无所有时离开你,让你崩溃,让你痛楚!
在这场麻药秀中,你我都是主角.
放眼望去,处处充满了绮丽诱人的美妙东西,
它们在你意气风发时爱上你,
当你风光不在时,又投入另一个人怀抱里!
麻药它们说: 我们来自加州!!
我们真的喜爱你们, 真的想奉献给你们.
条子和男同性恋者们已经做好了一个美丽吹气娃娃(不会再来骚扰你们了).....
(我真的)恨死今天了,但谁会陪我渡过今夜呢 .....
放眼望去,处处充满了绮丽诱人的美妙东西,
它们却都会在你们一无所有时离开你,让你崩溃,让你痛楚!
它们在你意气风发时爱上你,

The drugs they say
Make us feel so hollow
We love in vain
Narcissistic and so shallow
The cops and queers
To swim you have to swallow
Hate today
No love for tomorrow

We're all stars now in the dope show
We're all stars now in the dope show
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
Who want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low
And blow your mind
We're all stars now in the dope show
We're all stars now in the dope show
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not then they love another
The drugs they say
Are made in California
We love your face
We'd really like to sell you
The cops and queers
Make good-looking models
I hate today
Who will I wake up with tomorrow?
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
Who want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low
And blow your mind
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not then they love another
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
Who want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low
And blow your mind
They'll blow your mind
We're all stars now in the dope show
We're all stars now in the dope show

Mechanical Animals (机械化动物) (10/23 update)
我们已经脱胎换骨,完美无瑕......在我们灵魂逝去的那天.
也许我们并不是那么有人性吧!
不然为何我们哭泣,我们就会生锈呢.
我是一颗不定时炸弹,而你们却空洞洞的如"GOD"中的"O"般, 如全自动的死机械.
啊!!!!!我永远不会为你变成那样!
啊!!!!!我也永远不会从你那得到解脱!
它们将永远无动于衷,永远没有任何存在的意义........
你是我的机器新娘! 是珍贵的芭比娃娃! 一个迷你的落难皇后!
我是一颗不定时炸弹,而你们却空洞洞的如"GOD"中的"O"般, 如全自动的死机械.
啊!!!!!我永远不会为你变成那样!
啊!!!!!我也永远不会从你那得到解脱!
它们将永远无动于衷,永远没有任何存在的意义........
你是我的机器新娘! 是珍贵的芭比娃娃! 一个迷你的落难皇后!
这不是我啊!!我不要变成机械人.......
我祇是一个玩着"自裁国王"游戏的男孩啊!......

We were neurophobic and perfect
The day that we lost our souls
Maybe we weren't so human
If we cry we will rust
And I was a hand grenade
That never stopped exploding
You were automatic and
As hollow as the "o" in god
I am never gonna be the one for you
I am never gonna save the world from you
But they'll never be good to you
Or bad to you
they'll never be anything
Anything at all
You were my mechanical bride
Phenobarbidoll
A manniqueen of depression
With the face of a dead star
And I was a hand grenade
That never stopped exploding
You automatic and
As hollow as the "o" in god
I am never gonna be the one for you
I am never gonna save the world from you
But they'll never be good to you
Or bad to you
they'll never be anything
Anything at all
This isn't me I'm not mechanical

I'm just a boy
Playing the suicide king

Rock is Dead (摇滚已死) (10/24 update)
放眼皆是原始的猴子带着外星宝宝.
安非他命是男生用的,十字架是给女生玩的
世界已经蛛网满遍,都是行尸走骸, 歹活不如好死!
一无所有了! 一无所有了!
摇滚彻底覆灭了!! 痛不欲生!
你的性和你的毒品,是唯一还能值得一顾的东西,
所以放下矜持,先搞再说吧!
上帝只是电视里的东西罢了!!!!
1000个妈妈正在向它祈祷着!
我们也顿时感到充满了希望.....充满了狗屎的希望!
创造一个属于我们自己的神来膜拜,来抚慰心灵吧!
脱掉平时虚伪的面具替身!.....
上帝只是电视里的东西罢了!!!!
你的性和你的毒品,是唯一还能值得一顾的东西,
所以放下矜持,先搞再说吧!

All simple monkeys with alien babies
Amphetamines for boys
And crucifixes for ladies
Sampled and soulless
Worldwide and real webbed
You sell all the living
For more safer dead
Anything to belong
Anything to belong
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all the we're fed
So fuck all your protests and
Put them bed
God is the tv
1,000 mothers are praying for it
We're so full of hope
And so full of shit
Build a new god
To medicate and to ape
Sell us ersatz
Dressed up and real fake
Anything to belong
Anything to belong
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all the we're fed
So fuck all your protests and
Put them bed
God is the tv
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all the we're fed
So fuck all your protests and
Put them bed

Disassociative (与世隔绝) (10/25 update)
我能告诉你它们在太空中说些什么: 我们的世界太灰暗了
但是当灵魂被数位化时,身体也随之变化了.....
这世界杀死了我!这世界杀死了我!我与世隔绝了...
我已经无觉无感,我已经无觉无感,我知道.....
我被困住了!我不要漂流在恐惧之中如同太空迷航一样
我的爱人啊!有时我们处身滨临崩溃的状态.
我们在太空中写着歌,如同我们已经死去消失一般
这世界杀死了我!这世界杀死了我!我与世隔绝了...
这世界杀死了我!这世界杀死了我!我与世隔绝了...
我被困住了!我不要漂流在恐惧之中如同太空迷航一样
我被困住了!我不要漂流在恐惧之中如同太空迷航一样
我已经无觉无感,我已经无觉无感,我已经无觉无感,
我被困住了!我不要漂流在恐惧之中如同太空迷航一样.....

I can tell you what they say in space
That our earth is too grey
But when the spirit is so digital
The body acts this way
That world was killing me
That world was killing me
Disassociative
The nervous systems down,
The nervous systems down
I know
The nervous systems down,
The nervous systems down
I know
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear
A dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear
A dead astronaut in space
Sometimes we walk like
We were shot through
Our heads, my love
We write a song in space
Like we are already
Dead and gone
Your world was killing me
Your world was killing me
Disassociative
Your world was killing me
Your world was killing me
Disassociative
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear
A dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear
A dead astronaut in space
The nervous systems down,
The nervous systems down,
The nervous systems down,
The nervous systems down
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear
A dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear
A dead astronaut in space

The Speed of Pain (激痛) (10/26 update) (05/17/2001 修改)
它们如同摘花朵般地撕裂了我们的喉咙,
汁液也被彻底榨乾
当你需要它, 它稍纵即逝.
当你蹭恨它, 它却形影不离
别忘了,当你们自认是自由时, 回荡在你们内心的,是我的嘶哄!
某天,我要超脱这激痛.....,某天,我要超脱这激痛.....
我愿我能沉睡, 但我却芒刺在背, 在我入世(认识你)之后的每一天!
当你需要它, 它稍纵即逝.
当你蹭恨它, 它却形影不离
别忘了,当你们自认是自由时, 回荡在你们内心的,是我的嘶哄!
某天,我要超脱这激痛.....,某天,我要超脱这激痛.....
对我撒谎吧! 对我哭诉吧! 对我奉献吧!我愿意.....
谎言陪着我! 死亡陪着我! 牺牲陪着我!!我愿意.....
延续所有披裹在你们枯发中的秘密(信念)!永不变卦
延续所有披裹在你们枯发中的秘密(信念)!永不变卦
对我撒谎吧! 对我哭诉吧! 对我奉献吧!我愿意.....
谎言陪着我! 死亡陪着我! 牺牲陪着我!!我愿意.....
我希望至少我们死后能够永远携手同心,
我希望至少我们死后能够永远携手同心,
我希望我们死后能够携手同心........

They slit our throats
Like we were flowers
And our milk has been
Devoured
When you want it
It goes away too fast
Times you hate it
It always seems to last
Just remember when you think
You're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me
(thought, not spoken):
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day
I wish I could sleep
But I can't lay on my back
Because there's a knife
For everyday that I've known you
When you want it
It goes away too fast
Times you hate it
It always seems to last
Just remember when you think
You're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me
(thought, not spoken):
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me
I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me
I would
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair always
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair always
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me
I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me
I would
I hope at least we die holding hands
for always
I hope at least we die holding hands
for always
I hope at least we die holding hands

Posthuman (后人类) (10/27 update)
她有一双摄人的眼神,和如海洛英般的嘴唇!
她要我一定要样甘乃迪般的完美优越!
这不是上帝!这不是上帝!
上帝只是一堆统计数字!上帝只是一堆统计数字!
说吧!" 给我看看所有他们在歌颂的那些无能的明星们!"
这是一次真诚的狂放!
所谓的上帝, 只不过是一堆你无法计算的数字,
而你是后人类, 你是电缆线!
她是个虔诚的朝圣者, 忠贞的信徒, 谦逊且入世
她是像Jackie-O的圣人
这不是上帝!这不是上帝!
上帝只是一堆统计数字!上帝只是一堆统计数字!

说吧!" 给我看看所有他们在歌颂的那些无能的明星们!"
这是一次真诚的狂放!
(昏厥的白人):所有的华丽都是冰冷的!所有的华丽都是冰冷的!

She's got eyes like zapruder
And a mouth like heroin
She wants me to be
Perfect like Kennedy
This is not god, this is not god
God is just a statistic,
God is just a statistic
Say,
Show me the dead stars,
All of them sing
This is a orion
Religious and clean
God is a number you cannot count to
You are posthuman and hardwired
She's pilgrim and pagan
Softworn and so-cial
In all of her dreams
She's a saint like Jackie-O
This isn't god, this isn't god
God is just a statistic,
God is just a statistic
Say, show me the dead stars,
All of them sing
This is a orion
Religious and clean
(Coma White):
All that glitters is cold, all that glitters is cold

I Want to Disappear (我想消失) (10/28 update)
瞧瞧我, 没有信仰; 瞧瞧我, 如此空虚
瞧瞧我, 我曾是一个处女;瞧瞧我, 现在变成了妓女
我喜欢这样! 我就要这样! 我是千变万化,独一无二的
嘿~~!我妈妈在那里呀!!
嘿~~!我爸爸又是谁呀!!
嘿~~!我们只爱消沉堕落, 这样才让我们感到我们是被需要的!
我知道....我想要消失掉!!
我想早死,我想出卖灵魂
给我你所有的药,让我去吧!
昨日, 我是虚无主义者; 此时此刻,我只觉得无聊透顶!!!
照时间来算, 我已经够老了! 但我不想涉世太深呀!
嘿~~!我妈妈在那里呀!!
嘿~~!我爸爸又是谁呀!!
嘿~~!我们只爱消沉堕落, 这样才让我们感到我们是被需要的!
我知道....我想要消失掉!!

Look at me now
I've got no religion
Look at me now
I'm so vacant
Look at me now
I was a virgin
Look at me now
Grew up to be a whore
And I want it
I believe it
I'm a million different things
And not a one you know
Hey, and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now
But I know
I wanna disappear
I wanna die young
And Sell my soul
Use up all your drugs
And make me come
Yesterday man,
I was a nihilist and
Now today I'm
Just too fucking bored
And I want it
I believe it
By the time I'm old enough
I won't know anything at all
Hey, and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now
But I know
I wanna disappear

I Don't Like the Drugs (but the Drugs like me) (我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我) (10/29 update)
我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我. 我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我.......
安分守己的宝贝呀! 我们都是异性恋白人, 我们的性观念也非常保守
安分守己的宝贝呀! 我们工作不求表现,生活也相当朴素. 我们的告解都可以上电视了!
你和我都药量不足,才会堕落到快变成傻瓜了! 简直无要可救的地步!
我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我. 我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我.......
安分守己的宝贝呀! 我们的上帝是白人耶! 是有原罪的耶!
我们在做小便测试,我们在祷告着.
安分守己的宝贝呀! 我们宛如处子, 让自己看起来像个人样
安分守己的宝贝呀! 我们已经戒掉毒品了! 还要花15分钟来反省!
安分守己的宝贝呀! 我们在大声疾呼了! 我们强调(它)如同基督信徒面对自杀的态度一样!
你和我都药量不足,才会堕落到快变成傻瓜了! 简直无要可救的地步!
我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我. 我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我.......
在我们的灵魂里有一个装满毒品洞, 我们感到非常满足.
我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我. 我不爱毒品,但毒品爱我.......

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
Norm life baby:
We're white and oh so hetero and
Our sex is missionary.
Norm life baby:
We're quitters and we're sober
Our confessions will be televised.
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all.
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
Norm life baby:
God is white and unforgiving
We're piss tested and we're praying.
Norm life baby:
I'm just a sample of a soul
Made to look just like a human being.
Norm life baby:
We're rehabbed and we're ready
For our 15 minutes of shame.
Norm life baby:
We're talkshown and we're pointing
Just like christians at a suicide.
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all.
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine.
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs

I'm as fake as a wedding cake
And I'm vague and I know that I'm
Homopolitan
Pitifully predictable
Correctly political

Better in the head and in bed
At the office
I can suck it and smile
New

I can choke and diet on coke
I'm spun and I know
That I'm stoned and rolling
Lifelike and poseable
Hopeless and disposable

I've got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed
At the office
I can suck it and smile
New

Don't let them know how far you go
Or that you use your lovers
Oh look, you're like a VCR
Stick something in to know
Just who you are
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I've got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed
At the office
I can suck it and smile

Fundamentally Loathsome (恨之入骨) (11/01 update)
我想苏醒在你的白色世界, 白色太阳,
我想没有痛苦的苏醒在你的世界
但自从你麻木不仁后, 我将面对着没有希望的未来
当我憎恨, 我知道我还有知觉,
当你爱怜, 你知道那不是真实
不!
我默默地承受这恶俗的世界, 就这样步入地狱.....
一切了无生趣, 我希望能加入它们
我知道该怎么做, 尽我所能的做......
当我憎恨,我知道我还有知觉,
当你爱怜, 你知道那不是真实
我不顾一切去爱你, 但如果我爱我自己, 我势必要牺牲你......

I want to wake up in your
White, white sun
And I want to wake up in your world
With no pain
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday
While you are numb all of the way
When I hate it I know I can feel but
When you love you know it's not real
No
And I am resigned to this wicked fucking world
On its way to hell
The living are dead and
I hope to join them too
I know what to do and I do it well...
When I hate it I know I can feel but
When you love you know it's not real
No
Shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself I'd be shooting you

The Last Day On Earth (末路穷途-在地球上的最后一天) (10/27 update)
昨日彷彿如已是百万年前,
在我过去的人生里, 我扮演着一个屁眼
现在,我找到了你, 几乎已太迟了.
这片土地已经被人遗忘
我苟延残喘, 我们的皮囊几经风霜
没有你,我在这非常空虚, 我等于没有了义肢了!
我知道这是最后一天在这片土地上了!
等这颗行星灭亡, 我们就能永远相守
我知道这是最后一天在这片土地上了! 我们将永不分离......
卑鄙的小人们, 慢慢地自相残杀, 挑拨是非
我们摧毁了大自然的平衡, 给下一代撒下祸种
没有你,我在这非常空虚, 我知道它们要我死
我知道这是最后一天在这片土地上了!
等这颗行星灭亡, 我们就能永远相守
我知道这是最后一天在这片土地上了!
我们将永不分离......

Yesterday was a million years ago
In all my past lives I played an asshole
Now I found you, it's almost too late
And this earth seems obliviating
We are trembling in our crutches
High and dead our skin is glass
I'm so empty here without you
I crack my xerox hands
I know it's the last day on earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on earth
We'll never say goodbye
And the dogs slaughter each other softly
Love burns its casualties
We are damaged provider modules
Spill the seeds at our children's feet
I'm so empty here without you
I know they want me dead
I know it's the last day on earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on earth
We'll never say goodbye

Coma White (昏厥的白种人) (11/02 update)
在她的笑容背后, 有某种冷漠和虚缈
她正站在她的奇迹天桥上.....
(coma)"你来自一个美好的世界, 一个今天才弃我不顾的世界, 今天已经逝去了....."
一粒药就能使你麻痹,
一粒药就能使你呆滞,
一粒药就能使你变成另外一个人....
但世界上所有的药都不能够让她超脱自己

GOD EATGOD (神吃神-自相残杀) (update:11/14/00)
尊贵的神啊!你要扯下你自己的关节, 然后还挺住自己吗!?
尊贵的神啊!你能从树上爬下, 到"T"那用餐吗!?
尊贵的神啊! 记载说: 你是坐在黑色大礼车中的君王啊!
亲爱的约翰及所有神职人员无法再一次放你们的头颅在一起
在子弹之前,在虫蚀之前, 在权威人士们拿掉我的眼睛之前.....
唯一在微笑的是你那些我制造的玩偶
但你是塑胶制造的, 所以你够聪明
尊贵的神啊! 你的天空蓝的如同枪伤一般!
尊贵的神啊! 假如你还活着, 你知道我要杀了你.....

Dear god do you want to tear your knuckles down
and hold yourself

Dear god can you climb up that tree
meat in the shape of a 'T'

Dear god the paper says you were the King
in the black limousine

Dear John and all the King's men
can't put you head together again

Before the bullets
before the flies
before authorities take out my eyes
the only smiling are you dolls that I made
but you are plastic and so are your brains

Dear god the sky is as blue
as a gunshot wound

Dear god if you were alive
you know we'd kill you

Before the bullets
before the flies
before authorities take out my eyes
the only smiling are you dolls that I made
but you are plastic and so are your brains

THE LOVE SONG (爱之歌) (11/16/00 update)
子弹说: "我迷恋一把完美的手枪, 我该告诉她我变成了这样吗?"
神父告诉我们一定要忠实地迷恋一把完美的手枪, 我该告诉她我变成了这样吗?
爱歌回响在我脑海中, 几乎快杀掉我们!!
神父说: "你们爱你们的手枪,神,和政府吗!? 你们爱你们的手枪,神,和政府吗!?" (fuck~yeah!)
爱歌回响在脑海中, 几乎快杀掉我们!!
子弹说: "她告诉我: 我是一颗完美的子弹!.....未来我将成为明星!"
修女说: "我们应该认清自我, 她告诉我: 我是一颗完美的子弹!.....一个冒牌基督..."
爱歌回响在我的脑海中, 几乎快杀掉我们!!
神父说: "你们爱你们的手枪,神,和政府吗!? 你们爱你们的手枪,神,和政府吗!?" (fuck~yeah!)

The bullet:
"I've got a crush on a pretty pistol
should I tell her that I feel this way?
Father told us to be faithful
I've got a crush on a pretty pistol
should I tell her that I feel this way
I've got love songs in my head
that are killing us away"

The Father:
"do you love your
guns?" (yeah)
"god?"
(yeah)
"your government?"

"do you love your
guns?"
(yeah)
"god?"
(yeah)

(fuck yeah)

The bullet:
"She tells me I'm a pretty bullet
I'm gonna be a star someday
Mother says that we should look away
She tells me I'm a pretty bullet
an Imitation Christ
I've got love songs in my head
that are killing us away"

THE FIGHT SONG (战之歌) (11/17/00 update)
没有事情能比每天人世间的痛苦还令你感到窒息
孤立是那氧气面罩, 你让你的孩子靠这样幸存下来
我不是那虚构之神的奴隶; 我不是那混沌世界的奴隶
当我们安守本份时, 你当做没看到....所以现在我们变坏了!我们要让你活在恐惧之中
战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!
你将永远不会长大成为一个褒扬那些在你的名誉下的牺牲者的伟大摇滚明星
他们将弃人命于不顾, 然后说: 今天死亡大拍卖!!
当我们安守本份时, 你当做没看到....所以现在我们变坏了!我们要让你活在恐惧之中
我不是那虚构之神的奴隶; 我不是那混沌世界的奴隶
一个人的死并不是件悲剧! 一百万人死也只是一个统计数字
我不是那虚构之神的奴隶; 我不是那混沌世界的奴隶
战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!战斗!!

Nothing suffocates you more than
the passing of everyday human events
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make
your children breath into survive

But I'm not a slave to a god
that doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to world
that doesn't give a shit

And when we were good
you just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
we're going to scar your minds

fight, fight, fight, fight

You'll never grow up to be a big-
rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame
They'll just cut our wrists like
cheap coupons and say that death
was on sale today

And when we were good
you just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
we're scar your minds

But I'm not a slave to a god
that doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to world
that doesn't give a shit

the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
but death of a million is just a statistic

(CHORUS)

fight, fight, fight, fight

DISPOSABLE TEENS (低贱的青年) (11/18/00 update)
我是一道黑色彩虹, 我是只上帝的猴子. 我有一张激进暴戾的脸孔
我是一个邪魔歪道, 人工流产后残存下来的早产儿, 天生的(反政府)造反者
我要感谢你!妈, 我要感谢你!爸, 带我来到这个悲惨不堪的恶心世界....
我不曾真正恨过真神, 但是那个人们的神, 我恨
你说你要革命? 那么猿猴(的存在)是一个多大的讽刺,
你说你是一个革命家....我看你根本只是在胡说八道
我们是低贱的青年.....我们是低贱的青年.....我们是低贱的青年.....
你说你要革命? 那么猿猴(的存在)是一个多大的讽刺,
你说你是一个革命家....我看你根本只是在胡说八道!!
你越惧怕我们, 我们就越占上风! 你越惧怕我们, 我们就越占上风!
不要吃惊! 不要吃惊! 不要吃惊! 当我们摧毁这所有的一切!
我们是低贱的青年.....我们是低贱的青年.....我们是低贱的青年.....

and I'm a black rainbow
and I'm an ape of god
I got a face that's made for doing violence upon
I'm a teen distortion
survived abortion
a rebel from the waist down

I wanna thank you mom
I wanna thank you dad
for bringing this fucking world
to a bitter end
I never really hated a one true god
but the god of the people I hated

you said you wanted evolution
the ape was a great big hit
you say you want a revolution, man
and I say that you're full of shit

we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable

we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable

you said you wanted evolution
the ape was a great big hit
you say you want a revolution, man
and I say that you're full of shit

The more that you fear us
the bigger we get
the more that you fear us
the bigger we get
and don't be surprised, don't be surprised
don't be surprised when we destroy all of it

TARGET AUDIENCE (NARCISSUS NARCOSIS) (盲目观众) (11/26/00 update)
我很遗憾你的天空笼罩阴影, 你拿起刺刀想插进婴儿背里吗?
我也很遗憾你杀了甘乃迪和Huxley(美国小说作家)吗?
但我真的遗憾莎士比亚是你的替身, 你的苹果核刺穿我的喉咙!
我很遗憾你晴朗的周日像是支腐锈的钉子, 经营十字架生意也失败倒闭
但我只是一个慈悲的无名小卒
我见到所有年轻的信徒们, 你的盲目观众
我见到所有年长的骗徒们, 我们只是唱着他们的歌.....
我很遗憾必须活着, 身不由己的过日子吗?
我为Booth 和 Oswald 感到遗憾, pinks和古柯碱也是吗?
我很遗憾你从未检查在我脑袋里装的一颗炸弹
我的光环只是一个小针头那么大
我很遗憾我去找一位渎职的神父, 并向他许下愿望
但我只是一个慈悲的无名小卒
我见到所有年轻的信徒们, 你的盲目观众;
我见到所有年长的骗徒们, 我们只是唱着他们的歌:
"死亡村里, 我们全然自由, 你神父的, 你的监牢, 你的认知......"
我见到所有年轻的信徒们, 你的盲目观众.
我见到所有年长的骗徒们, 我们只是唱着他们的歌:
"Nah nah nuh nah naaa nuh nah nah nah nooo"
你只是一个冒牌货的复制品....

Am I sorry your sky went black,
put your knives in babies backs?
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedy's and Huxley too?

But I'm sorry Shakespeare
was your scapegoat
and your apples sticking into my throat
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails
and your crucifixion commercials failed
but I'm just a pitiful anonymous

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song

Am I sorry to be alive
putting my face in the beehive?
Am I sorry for Booth and Oswald, pinks and cocaine too?

I'm sorry you never check
the bag in my head for a bomb
and my halo was a needle hole
I'm sorry I saw a priest being beaten
and I made a wish
but I'm just a pitiful anonymous

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song
we all just sing their song

"the valley of death we are free
your father's your prison you see"

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song

you're just a copy of an imitation

"PRESIDENT DEAD" ("总统死了") (11/28/00 update)
(总统死了......太好了!)
这一切为了人民, 他们需要你. 暴戾之气逐渐升高, 宝贝!
总统死了就是一个徵兆. 在车头灯前被逮住, 法制下的神, 他的头盖骨是一块釉彩玻璃
天之骄子, 纸醉金迷. 激进的思想家利用买他们的票去找寻神的存在,如同一只小猪去逛博览会一样(可笑)
我们不要得到永生, 我们知道痛苦(比起永生)好的多了....
这一切为了人民, 他们需要你. 暴戾之气逐渐升高, 宝贝!
服下药后去干活, 我们不能在此艰难之际全部成为我们不满下的牺牲者(暴戾之气逐渐升高,宝贝!)
每晚, 我们被钉上广场. 每晚, 我们总是不明究理 (暴戾之气逐渐升高, 宝贝!)
我们不要得到永生, 我们知道痛苦(比起永生)好的多了.....
这一切为了人民, 他们需要你......

this is for the people, they want you
this is for the people, they want you
getting high on violence, baby

President Dead is clueless
and he's caught in a headlight, police-stated god
and his skull is stained glass

incubated and jet set
the bitter thinkers buy their tickets
to go find god like a piggy in a fair

and we don't want to live forever
and we know that suffering is so much better

this is for the people, they want you
this is for the people, they want you
getting high on violence, baby

give the bills time to work
we all could be martyred in the
winter of our discontent

(getting high on violence, baby)

every night we are nailed into place and
every night we just can't seem to
ever remember the reason why

(getting high on violence, baby)

and we don't want to live forever
and we know that suffering is so much better

this is for the people, they want you
this is for the people, they want you
getting high on violence, baby

and we don't want to live forever
and we know that suffering is so much better

IN THE SHADOW OF THE VALLEY OF DEATH (在死亡谷的阴影里) (11/30/00 update)
我们没有未来, 天堂不是为我而建造的, 我们燃烧自己献给地狱, 能越快越好,
我希望我能成为国王, 然后我要知道我不是孤单一人
放蛆在裙摆上, 出售彼此的屎尿
有时我感到如此自己一文不质值, 有时我感到被遗弃
我愿我已经够好了! 然后我要知道我不是孤单一人
死亡是一个警察, 死亡是一位神父, 死亡是一组立体音响,
死亡是一台电视机, 死亡是一副塔罗牌, 死亡是一只天使,
死亡是我们的神......
杀光了我们, 他放进种子在我的身躯里, 栽培这颗乾枯的树
他是导火线, 而我只是那灰烬.....

We have no future
heaven wasn't made for me
we burn ourselves to hell
as fast as it can be
and I wish that I could be a king
then I'd know that I am not alone

Maggots put on shirts
Sell each others shit
sometimes I feel so worthless
sometimes I feel discarded
I wish that I was good enough
then I'd know that I am not alone

Death is policeman
Death is the priest
Death is the stereo
Death is a TV
Death is the Tarot
Death is an angel and
Death is our God
killing us all

she puts the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
she's a burning string
and I'm just the ashes

she put the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
she's a burning string
and I'm just the ashes

CRUCI-FICTION IN SPACE (太空中的十字架构) (12/02/00 update)
这是一场进化, 猴子, 人类, 还有枪
假使基督在美国德州, 撞针, 镰刀, 唯一的儿子
这是你的作品, 伊甸园的亚当是一颗炸弹
假如Jack是一名浸信教徒, 我们要喝他脑袋里的醇酒
这是一场进化, 猴子, 人类, 一把枪
我是一次革命, 如果我能放下我的手肘! 我是一个启示, 我被钉上了圣木
这是一场进化, 猴子, 人类, 一把枪!
我们死亡, 明日消失, 因为我们过去的种种所为!
他们在我们的地盘上迫害我们........
这是一场进化, 猴子, 人类, 一把枪..... 这是一场进化, 猴子, 人类, 一段耳语.....
.......苍蝇正等待着

this is evolution
the monkey
the man
and then the gun
if Christ was in Texas
the hammer
the sickle
the only son
this is your creation
the atom of Eden
was a bomb
if Jack was the Baptist
we'd drink wine
from the head

this is evolution
the monkey
the man
and then the gun

I am a revolution
pull my knuckles down
if I could
I am a revelation
and I'm nailed
to the Holy Wood

this is evolution
the monkey
the man
and then the gun

we are dead and tomorrow's canceled
because of things we did yesterday
we are dead and tomorrow's canceled
they crucify us in our space
in our space
in our space

this is evolution
the monkey
the man
and then the gun
flies are waiting

所有神的儿子都要被送到我们这完美之地...在太阳下,尘土中.....
在我心中有一片挡风玻璃, 我们像虫子一般, 是那么般的被欺压,被惊吓
在我咽下这一切之前,能否请你停下贪婪无餍的掠食? 我请求你.....
放我在车队之中吧! 放我在那死亡游行队伍中吧!
帮我梳妆一下,帮我打理一下, 你们垂死的神啊!
天使们带着杵针, 戳进我们的双眼, 让这世界丑陋的光射进我们眼里
我们不再失明....我们不再失明....
放我在车队之中吧! 放我在那死亡游行队伍中吧!
现在我们握着那丑陋的头颅, 妓女玛利亚在床上等着
他们的视线正观望着我们在阴影下完美的死去...在太阳下,尘土中.....

We are damned and we are dead
all god's children to be sent
to our perfect place in the sun
and in the dirt

There's a windshield in my heart
we are bugs so smeared and scarred
and could you stop the meat from thinking
before I swallow all of it,
could you please?

Put me in the motorcade
put me in the death parade
dress me up and take me
dress me up and make me
your dying god

angels with needles
poked through our eyes
let the ugly light
of the world in
we were no longer blind
we were no longer blind

Put me in the motorcade
put me in the death parade
dress me up and take me
dress me up and make me
your dying god

Now we hold the "ugly head"
the Mary-whore is at the bed
They've cast the shadow of our perfect death
in the sun and in the dirt.

THE NOBODIES (无名小卒) (12/07/00 update)
今天我污秽不堪, 我想洗心革面, 我知道明天我只是尘埃
今天我污秽不堪, 我想洗心革面, 我知道明天我只是尘埃....
我们是无名小卒, 我们想脱胎换骨, 当我们死去, 他们将知道我们是谁!.....
昨日我污秽不堪, 我也想洗心革面, 但我知道我永远只是尘埃.....
我们是无名小卒, 我们想脱胎换骨, 当我们死去, 他们将知道我们是谁!.....
一些儿童们死在另一天, 我们吃机械维生, 接着我们祈祷
在病态的信仰狂热中上吐下泻
你应该曾见过审判日(的到来)......
我们是无名小卒, 我们想脱胎换骨, 当我们死去, 他们将知道我们是谁!.....

Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

Yesterday I was dirty
wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

Yesterday I was dirty
wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

Some children died the other day
we fed machines and then we prayed
puked up and down in morbid faith
you should have seen the ratings that day
We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

THE DEATH SONG (死亡之歌) (12/09/00 update)
我们骑着子弹, 乘风直捣上帝之处, 刚好他也想要做个了结
我们嗑下药物, 蓄势待发, 我们希望天堂是真实的
我在电视上看到一个条子在扁一位神父, 我知道他们也已经杀死了我们的英雄!!
我们唱起死亡之歌, 孩子们.....因为我们没有未来, 我们只想要和你一样......唱着死亡之歌!
我们在大地上燃起一支蜡烛, 朝向地狱之路而去,
假藉我们每次在天堂里都愿意接受(神的)指引, 我们知道这一切都是捏造的.....
我在电视上看到一个神父杀死了一个条子, 我知道他们也是英雄!!
我们唱起死亡之歌, 孩子们.....因为我们没有未来, 我们只想要和你一样......唱着死亡之歌!
我们在一颗小炸弹上写下我们的祈祷文, 附上一个吻, 然后送到上帝那去....
我们唱起死亡之歌, 孩子们.....因为我们没有未来, 我们只想要和你一样......
我们就是全世界, 但是我们没有未来, 我们只想要和你一样, 唱着死亡之歌......

we're on a bullet
and we're headed straight into god
even he'd like to end it too
we take a pill, get a face
buy our ticket
and we hope that heaven's true
I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
and they know they killed our heroes too

We sing the death song kids
because we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
and we want to be just like you

Let's sing the death song kids

we light a candle on an earth
we made into hell
and pretend that we're in heaven
each time we do we get
the blind man's ticket
and we know that nothing's true
I saw priest kill a cop on the TV
and I know now they're our heroes too

We sing the death song kids
because we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
and we want to be just like you

we write our prayers on a little bomb
kiss it on the face and send it to god

(CHORUS)

We were the world
but we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
we want to be just like you.

THE LAMB OF GOD (神的羔羊) (12/17/00 update)
有个基督在一方铁壳里, 有滩鲜血洒在柏油路上
照相机将会把你创造成神, 这就是为何Jack变成圣人的原因
假使你黯淡死去, 你的收视率就会剧降, 且被人遗忘
但如果他们在他们的电视里把你杀了, 你就成为殉教者; 一只神的羔羊
一如往常, 世界一成不变......
那有(约翰) 南侬和只快乐的枪
那有一段台词在柏油路上, 我们寻找着神的羔羊, 我们寻找着Mark David
假使你黯淡死去, 你的收视率就会剧降, 且被人遗忘
但如果他们在他们的电视里把你杀了, 你就成为殉教者; 一只神的羔羊
一如往常, 世界一成不变......
他(耶稣)花了3天去死, 所以再生时就享有长期不断的权利
神的羔羊对我们有恩,神的羔羊却不允许你接纳我们
一如往常, 世界依然一成不变......

There was Christ in the metal shell
there was blood on the pavement
The camera will make you god
that's how Jack became sainted

If you die when there's no one watching
and your ratings drop and you're forgotten
if they kill you on their TV
you're a martyr and a lamb of god
nothing's going to change
nothing's going to change the world

There was Lennon and a happy gun
There were words on the pavement
we were looking for the lamb of god
we were looking for Mark David

If you die when there's no one watching
and your ratings drop and you're forgotten
if they kill you on their TV
you're a martyr and a lamb of god

Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
the world

it took three days for him to die
the born again could buy the serial rights
lamb of god have mercy on us
lamb of god won't you grant us

Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
the world

If you die when there's no one watching
and your ratings drop and you're forgotten
if they kill you on their TV
you're a martyr and a lamb of god
nothing's going to change the world

BORN AGAIN (重生) (12/19/00 update)
你们想或是不想让这变成一首歌?
自个唱唱是不会被人视为造反者的
这艺术疲软又无力, 在这浮华不实的躯壳里,
我是一只名字被拼错的猴子
"我将放下你的DISCO, 拿掉你的心脏"......我将要重生了....
我是路人甲, 我是新人乙, 我是和你们一样愚蠢的人
我是路人甲, 我是新人乙, 我是和你们一样愚蠢的人
你们想或是不想接受这个打击?
这是否让你们感到自己是它的一部份
"我将放下你的DISCO, 拿掉你的心脏"......我将要重生了....
我是路人甲, 我是新人乙, 我是和你们一样愚蠢的人.......
这傀儡之谷是死亡之谷........

Do you or don't you want this to be your song?
It doesn't take a rebel to sing along.
This art is weak
in its pretty frame
and I am a monkey with
a misspelled name
"I'll put down you disco
and take you heart away.
I'll put down you disco
and take your heart away"
I am born again

I'm someone else
I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else
I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

do you or don't you want to take this hit?
Does it make you feel like you're a part of "it."
"I'll put down you disco
and take you heart away.
I'll put down you disco
and take your heart away"
I am born again

I'm someone else
I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else
I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

the valley of the dolls is
the valley of the dead
the valley of the dolls is
the valley of the dead

(CHORUS)

I am born again

BURNING FLAG (焱旗) (01/12/01 update)
他们想要卖光它,买光它,让它消失匿迹
一个好的上帝是很难找得到的
我要混入那些巴不得我去死的人群中
现在,我觉得我融入其中了
繁衍你的死亡,用性(别)来区分
把暴力全加起来,你又得到了什么?
我们全都是明日之星,我们在等待
我们全都受过创伤,我们在憎恨着
我们全都是在你燃烧旗帜上的明星,
你可以拿着你的枪指着我,希望我能离远一点
但如果上帝还活着,他无论如何都会恨你
我右翼的翅膀拍动着,左翼则暗淡无光
为孩子们去听一下,但他们却言之无物
他们阴险下流
在选举投票日,我们得到我们的ABC和我们的F.U.C.K
繁衍你的死亡,用性(别)来区分
把暴力全加起来,你又得到了什么?
我们全都是明日之星,我们在等待
我们全都受过创伤,我们在憎恨着
我们全都是在你燃烧旗帜上的明星,
你可以拿着你的枪指着我,希望我能离远一点
但如果上帝还活着,他无论如何都会恨你

They want to sell it out
but it up
dumb it down
a good god is hard to find
I'll join the crowd that
wants to see me dead
right now I feel I belong
for the first time

multiply your death
divide by sex
add up the violence and
what do you get?
We are all just stars and we're waiting
we are all just scarred and we're hating
we are all just stars on your burning flag

you can point your gun at me
and hope it will go away
if god was alive,
he would hate you anyway

my right wing is flapping
the left one is gray
let's hear it for the kids but
nothing they say
they gyrate and G-rate
on Election Day
we got out ABC's and our F U C K

multiply your death
divide by sex
add up the violence and
what do you get?
We are all just stars and we're waiting
we are all just scarred and we're hating
we are all just stars on your burning flag

you can point your gun at me
and hope it will go away
but if god was alive,
he would hate you anyway

COMA BLACK (昏厥的黑人) (01/13/01 update)
a)伊甸园眼
我的嘴是一个育婴床, 里面正在滋育着谎言
我不知道那天是那种爱
我的心是一个迷你的血块
我挑起它,它永不会愈合的,它永远摆脱不了
在伊甸园眼,我焚烧了所有的美好
对于逃走,我们太沉默
对于死亡,我们太消极......
在伊甸园眼,我焚烧了所有的美好
对于逃走,我们太沉默
对于死亡,我们太消极.....
这里从未是属于我的世界
你们带走了天使,我要杀了我自己去让所有人付出代价.....
这里从未是属于我的世界
你们带走了天使,我要杀了我自己去让所有人付出代价.....
我曾要告诉她,她是我在这枯竭的世上,唯一还能去爱的
但"爱"这个简单的字眼本身,早已随风逝去
这里从未是属于我的世界
你们带走了天使,我要杀了我自己去让所有人付出代价.....
在伊甸园眼,我焚烧了所有的美好
对于逃走,我们太沉默
对于死亡,我们太消极.....
这里从未是属于我的世界
你们带走了天使,我要杀了我自己去让所有人付出代价.....
b)不协调的苹果
她的心是一颗有血斑的蛋
我们没有妥为照顾
蛋破裂了且流出血水
我们永远无法修护......

a) EDEN EYE
My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn't know what love was on that day
my heart's a tiny bloodclot
I picked at it
it never heals it never goes away

I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

This was never my world
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

I would have told her then
she was the only thing
that I could love in this dying world
but the simple word "love" itself
already died and went away

This was never my world
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

b) APPLE OF DISCORD
Her heart's bloodstained egg
we didn't handle with care
it's broken and bleeding
and we can never repair

VALENTINE'S DAY (情人节) (01/13/01 update)
她是电视的色彩, 她的嘴唇像个铁皮蛇般地盘踞在下
虽然圣林说过: 他们会记得这如同情人节般的日子
苍蝇正等待着.....
在死亡谷的阴影里......,在死亡谷的阴影里.......
他们撕开我们的手脕,并送我们去天堂
大洪水之后的第一朵花.....
我今天看见那位怀孕的少女
她不知道它(救世主)已经胎死腹中
甚至认为它还活着
我们其中有人已准备为死而生
苍蝇正等待着.....
在死亡谷的阴影里......,在死亡谷的阴影里......,在死亡谷的阴影里.......
他们撕开我们的手脕,并送我们去天堂
大洪水之后的第一朵花.....
在死亡谷的阴影里......,在死亡谷的阴影里......,在死亡谷的阴影里.......

She was the color of TV
her mouth curled under like a metal snake
although Holy Wood was sad
they'd remember this as Valentine's day

flies are waiting

In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death

slit our wrists and send us to heaven
the first flower after the flood

I saw that pregnant girl today
she didn't know that it was dead inside
even though it was alive
some of us are really born to die

flies are waiting

In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death

slit our wrists and send us to heaven
the first flower after the flood

In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death

THE FALL OF ADAM (亚当的堕落) (01/13/01 update)
Abraham Lincoln镇的车子,来到这里处置我们的国王与皇后
为了庆典需要,他们载歌练舞
当一个世界到了尾声
某种新的事物将揭开序幕
但是是在没有恐惧的笼罩下
不用声张
因为我们正开始要再一次超越(结束)它....

The Abraham Lincoln town cars
arrive to dispose of our king and queen
they orchestrated dramatic new scenes
for Celebritarian needs

When one world ends
something else begins
but without a scream
just a whisper because we
just start it over again

KING KILL 33 (国王杀了33) (01/13/01 update)
这是你想要的吗? 这是你得到的
让所有你的生活全变得乱七八糟
你从未公平的接纳我,对待我
却因我的信仰和穿着来指责我
你闯了大祸, 找代罪羔羊
你将会获得蓝色枯萎的种子
你从未给我一个机会让我展现自我
或是甚至一个烂机会都不放过
但我必须让你看看
你扮演的角色, 我将用一个简单的陷阱就把你摧毁
恨我的那个世界曾掌管一切
但现在我终于夺回自主权
你不择手段这样整我
我要你这就去杀了国王
我并不感到遗憾,我并不感到抱歉
这是你应得的惩罚
我并不感到遗憾,我并不感到抱歉
这是你应得的惩罚
国王杀了33!!国王杀了33!!

Is this what you wanted?
This is what you get.
Turned all your lives into this shit.
You never accepted or treated me fair
blame me for what I believe
and I wear.
You fucked yourselves and you
raised these sheep
the blue and the withered seeds
you will reap.
You never gave me a chance to be me
Or even a fucking chance just to be.
But I have to show you that
you played a role
and I will destroy you with one simple hole.
The world that hates me has taken its toll
but now I have finally taken control.
You wanted so bad to make me this thing
and I want you now to just kill the king

and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve
and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve
and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve

COUNT TO 6 AND DIE (THE VACUUM OF INFINITE SPACE ENCOMPASSING)
(数到6然后死去--围绕在无限空间的虚无里) (01/13/01 update)

她睁大了她的双眼
她抓起一把尘沙,蔑视这个世界
她把她的嘴放在铁上
一个受到创痛小女孩的双唇
我有一只天使在大厅那儿
他正等着把我放进队伍之中
但我不祈求饶恕, 我的信念已经乾涸
她有基督的教条在身
死神徐徐的流进她的耳里
如同她不该听到歌声的音乐起伏
1...2...3...旋绕着...4...5...6...我们全躺下了...
少数的,有些人动作很快,有些人动作很好.....

She's got her eyes open wide
she's got the dirt and spit of the world
her mouth on the metal
the lips of a scared little girl

I've got an angel in the lobby
he's waiting to put me in line
I won't ask forgiveness
my faith has gone dry

She's got her Christian prescriptures
and death has crawled in her ear
like elevator music of songs
that she shouldn't hear

and it spins around 1...2...3
and we all lay down 4...5...6
some do it fast
some do it better in smaller amounts

and it spins around 1...2...3
and we all lay down 4...5...6
some do it fast
some do it better in smaller amounts

Left-out track from Dec. webcast (非收录之隐藏歌曲) (01/13/01 update)
亲爱的妈咪, 请告诉我地球真的是圆的吗?
告诉我, 快乐的幸运鸟是在那里被发现的?
告诉我, 为什么天空之上是如此的蓝?
还有告诉我,当你是个孩子时,你的妈咪有告诉你吗?
Mommy dear, tell me please Is the world really round?
Tell me, where is the blue bird of happiness found?
Tell me, why is the sky up above this so blue?
And when you were a child, did your mommy tell you?

Tainted Love 堕落的爱 (from the "Not Another Teen Movie" soundtrack)
我有不祥的预感,我必须赶紧
脱身
(那是)来自于你给我的锥心之痛
那份属于我们共有的爱
似乎已荡然无存
我失去了希望
在寂寥的深夜辗转难眠...

昔日我投入你的怀抱
今天我逃之夭夭
这是来自于你堕落的爱
我给了你所有男孩能够给你的一切
带着我的眼泪,那只不是冰山一角罢了
Oh...堕落的爱
堕落的爱

现在我知道我必须走了,必须逃离这一切
你并不是真的很想要从我这再得到什么
去让事情有所转机
你需要的是一个可以给你紧紧抱住的人
你认为爱就是去祈求(些什么)
可是很抱歉,我不以为然

昔日我投入你的怀抱
今天我逃之夭夭
这是来自于你堕落的爱
我给了你所有男孩能够给你的一切
带着我的眼泪,那只不是冰山一角罢了
Oh...堕落的爱
堕落的爱

拜托!别再来碰我
我不能忍受你挑逗的样子
我爱你!虽然你如此的伤害我
现在我要去收拾东西走了
堕落的爱,堕落的爱.......

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh...tainted love
Tainted love
Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh...tainted love
Tainted love
Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm going to pack my things and go
Tainted love, tainted love...
Touch me baby, tainted love...

Suicide Is Painless 自杀是无痛的 (from the "Blair Witch 2"-Soundtrack)(02/10 update)
透过清晨的雾气,我明白到
事情的真相皆是来自自我压抑下的痛苦所生
我明白了,我知道了.......
自杀是无痛的
这带来了许多改变,只要我愿意,我可以自行取舍
我试着找个方法去做,所有和我们一丝愉悦有关的(方法)
除了心头之恨外
但现在我知道一切为时以晚,还有.....
生存的游戏是难玩的,....
总而言之,我注定输掉这盘了
某日我将掩埋那失败的记录卡(?)
所以我该说的都说了
胜利的唯一方法是欺骗,还有在我精疲力竭前击倒它
然后让另一个(人)顶替我的位置,让唯一无痛的事迹(延续下去)
时间之剑将会刺穿我们的皮肤
开始时并不会感到疼痛
但后来(痛苦)就会发作
那痛越来越剧烈.....看着它撕牙裂嘴的模样,但是......
一个勇敢的人有一次请求我给他解答
该当这样做与否?
我回答:"oh!为何问我?"
因为自杀是无痛的.....
这带来了许多改变,只要我愿意,我可以自行取舍
.......你也可以选择和我做一样的事

Through early morning fog I see,
Visions of the things to be,
The pains that are withheld for me,
I realize and I can see...
That suicide is painless.
It brings on many changes.
And I can take or leave it if I please.
I try to find a way to make,
All our little joys relate,
Without that ever-present hate,
But now I know that it's too late, and...
The game of life is hard to play,
I'm gonna lose it anyway.
The losing card I'll someday lay,
So this is all I have to say.
The only way to win is cheat,
And lay it down before I'm beat,
And to another give my seat,
For that's the only painless feat.
The sword of time will pierce our skins.
It doesn't hurt when it begins.
But as it works its way on in,
The pain grows stronger...watch it grin, but...
A brave man once requested me,
to answer questions that are key.
Is it to be or not to be?
And I replied 'Oh why ask me?'
'Cause suicide is painless.
It brings on many changes.
And I can take or leave it if I please.
...And you can do the same thing if you choose.

A Rose and A Baby Ruth 一朵玫瑰和宝贝露丝 (From the "Last Tour on Earth"-Import CD) (02/10 update)
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
我们曾吵闹不休, 一种幼稚的争吵
现在我忧郁到知道自己会变成什么
我不能在电话上和你说清楚
我甚至到你家去也说不清楚
所以现在我送你一个礼物
只是为了证明我说的是实话
亲爱的,我相信当你收到(礼物)时,你就笑不出来了
这是玫瑰和宝贝露丝
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, ahh
我能够送你某些种类的兰花
但那些是目前在我牛仔裤里所剩的东西
但当我们长大后
某天我将会证明,我说的都是实话
我也将亲吻你,然后牵着你
这是玫瑰和宝贝露丝

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, ahh

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
We had a quarrel
A teenage quarrel
Now I'm as blue as I know how to be
I can't call you on the phone
I can't even see you at your home
So I'm sending you this present
Just to prove that I'm telling the truth
Dear, I believe you won't laugh when you receive
This rose and a Baby Ruth
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, ahh
I could have sent you an orchid of some kind
But that's all I had in my jeans at the time
But when we grow up
Some day I'll show up
Just to prove I was telling the truth
I'll kiss you too then I'll hand to you
This rose and a Baby Ruth
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo

Get My Rocks Off 解放我的摇滚 (From the "Last Tour on Earth"-Import CD) (02/10 update)
某些人需要些杀人魔鬼,某些人需要古柯碱
某些人需要些仙人掌汁,用以净化脑袋
某些人需要2个女人,某些人需要酒精(烈酒)
每一个人都需要依赖一些东西,但我需要的是至高无上的权力.....
用来解放我的摇滚,解放摇滚
用来解放我的摇滚,解放摇滚
自高山解放我的摇滚,一路滚下
我可能干你干的正是时候,我也许还可以在来几次
我也许可以带领你进入某种你还没有心理准备去接受的事物
我也可能要你的宝贝,我也可能要你的钱财
我也可能要你的妈妈反过来拜访我.....
用来解放我的摇滚,解放摇滚
用来解放我的摇滚,解放摇滚
自高山解放我的摇滚,一路滚下
有时我梦见小孩子 带给我最恒久的欢乐
有时我梦见动物,有时我梦见男孩们
有时我自断生计,有时我鼓吹死亡
有时我就不屑一切,爬回床被里.....
用来解放我的摇滚,解放摇滚
用来解放我的摇滚,解放摇滚
自高山解放我的摇滚,一路滚下

Some men need some killer weed, some men need cocaine
Some men need some cactus juice, to purify the brain
Some men need two women, some need alcohol
Everybody needs a little something, but lord I need it all
To get my rocks off, rocks off
To get my rocks off, rocks off
Get my rocks off the mountain
And roll 'em on down
I may do you one time, and I may do you more
I may turn you into something, that you ain't ready for
I might want your body, and I might want your bread
I might want your momma to come visit me instead
To get my rocks off, rocks off
To get my rocks off, rocks off
To get my rocks off, rocks off
Get my rocks off the mountain
And roll 'em on down
Sometimes I dream of chicks, to bring me ever lasting joys
Sometimes I dream of animals, sometimes I dream of boys
Sometimes I kill the living, sometimes I raise the dead
Sometimes I say just fuck it all, and crawl back into bed
To get my rocks off, rocks off
To get my rocks off, rocks off
To get my rocks off, rocks off
Get my rocks off the mountain
And roll 'em on down

Astonishing Panorama Of The Endtimes 惊骇末世景观 (From the "Last Tour on Earth"-live CD) (02/07 update)
那男孩有一颗像原子弹的头
在十字架前吊死了他,如同神的第一个儿子
他早已等待多时,就等着这一切(到来)
那男孩是15(岁?),但看起来有16(岁?)
渴望自耶稣的牢笼里解放出来
他早已经撕下最后一页,"最后的怒吼"那页.....
暴力是为了人们,他们总是啃食着流血的手
暴力是为了人们,去找些他们需要的孩子们来
杀死你的神,杀死你的神,杀死你的电视机....
男孩被怠慢的神们洗涤了罪恶
如同天意般的烧毁他的十字架
他言不及义的说着话,像是颗傀儡的头
暴力是为了人们,他们总是啃食着流血的手
暴力是为了人们,去找些他们需要的孩子们来
这是你该去畏惧的......

The boy's got a head like an atom bomb
Hang him from a cross like the number one son
And he’s been waiting so long
To get it on
The boy's 15 but he's 16 gauge
Wants to break out from his Jesus cage
He's already torn out the last page
It's the "latest rage"
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need
Kill your god, Kill your god
Kill your TV
The boy's purified by the quitter gods
Burning up his cross like a revelation
And his glass jaw opens
Like a puppet head
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need

this is what you should fear you are what you should fear......

Apple Of Sodom Sodom的苹果 (from the "Lost Highway"-Soundtrack) (02/11 update)
我找到那果实的罪人时,已经为时已晚了
这是迄今最真实的中心点
我把苹果剖成2半
oh!我祈祷这不是真相.......
我得到了你从不能吃的东西........
我心湖乾涸,我神形俱灭
我弹着音弦来阻止我的成长
我祈求着死亡永驻
用雪覆盖我,用雪覆盖我......
雪覆盖我
我正走向死亡,我希望你也一快死去..........
雪覆盖我
我正走向死亡,我希望你也一快死去..........
从我这带走恨吧!!!恨我吧!!!恨我吧!!!
从我这带走恨吧!!!恨我吧!!!恨我吧!!!
1,2,3....他是一个虚有其表的模特儿,1,2,3....他只能原地站着不动
1,2,3....他是一个虚有其表的模特儿,1,2,3....他只能原地站着不动....
我得到了你从不能吃的东西........

I found the sinner of fruit is late
It is the center of truth today
I cut the apple in two
Oh, I pray it isn't true
I found the sinner of fruit is late
It is the center of truth today
I cut the apple in two
Oh, I pray it isn't true
I've got something you can never eat
I've got something you can never eat
I've got something you can never eat
I've got something you can never eat
I've drained my heart
And burned my soul
I struck a chord
To stop my growth
I pray the dying stays
To cover me in snow
To cover me in snow
Cover me in snow
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too
Cover me in snow
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too
Take this from me, hate
Hate me, hate me
Take this from me, hate
Hate me, hate me
1, 2, 3, he is a speed bump mannequin
1, 2, 3, he can't move just stand still
1, 2, 3, he is a speed bump mannequin
1, 2, 3, he can't move just stand still
I've got something you can never eat

The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell 狱旅之遥 (from the "Spawn"-Soundtrack) (02/12 update)
我要飞进你得太阳
需要信念来让我麻木不仁
生活就如同一个青少年时期的基督
我是一个信徒,选定个自杀的日子
Oh!玛莉,玛莉
要这般的青春是多么的令人惊心动魄
玛莉,玛莉
要这般的青春是多么的令我惊心动魄
我要活下去,我要爱
但逃离地狱之路是多么的艰辛遥远
我要活下去,我要爱
但逃离地狱之路是多么的艰辛遥远
你没说过永远的誓约,就得受到这般的伤害.......
用我的方法奔逃出地狱
这里空无一物,(只剩)出卖灵魂后的躯壳
我的生命来去匆匆
要我为你这么做多少次呢?
要我为你这么做多少次呢?.........
为任何理由出卖我的灵魂,但除了为你之外......

I want to fly into your sun
Need faith to make me numb
Live like a teenage christ
I'm a saint, got a date with suicide

Oh Mary, Mary
To be this young is oh so scary
Mary, Mary
To be this young I'm oh so scared

I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell
I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this

Spin my way out of hell
There's nothing left this soul to sell
I live fast and die fast too
How many times I do this for you?
How many times I do this for you?

Mary, Mary
To be this young I'm oh so scared
I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell

I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this

I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell
Long hard road, out of hell
I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell

Sell my soul for anything, anything but you
Sell my soul for anything, anything but you

The Suck For Your Solution 刺耳的答覆 (from the "Private Parts"-Soundtrack) (02/13 update)
你开口闭口都是自杀言论,好像你是不死之身一样
全自动化的神力赐给予你一脑化学性的想法
我被你处决了,我被你处决了
你带着像安眠药般的眼神
如打麻醉剂一样地亲吻着我
将我溶解吞没,吞没,吞没了我的脑袋
我明天将要恨你,因为你今天弄得我想要恨你
我无法成为能让你信服之人
我不能成为你枕边的负心人
我将成为刺耳的答覆,告诉我你的性已经死亡
死亡,你的性已经死亡.......
我被你处决了,我被你处决了
我被你处决了自我生出那天起
所以疲惫和性压抑,还有.....
绝望的沉沦和索然无味的刺激
我们将会制造(属于)我们的该有的性徵
当我们不再能性交时我们将会去杀戮....

Your mouth is like a suicide talking like you'd never die
Automatic charisma for your chemical mind
I've suffered for you I've suffered for you
You're kissing me like benzocane with your sleeping pill eyes
Melting me down and suck, suck, sucking my brain
I'm gonna hate you tomorrow because you make me hate you today
I can't be the one that you believe in
I can't be the liar in your bed
I'll be the suck for your solution tell me that your sex is dead
Dead, your sex is dead
I'll suffer for you,I'll suffer for you
I've suffered for you since the day I was made
So tired and desexed and you were
Hopelessly soulless and bored of the thrill
We'll make our death sex some more
When we can't fuck then we kill

Down In The Park 公园下 (from the "Lunchbox"-Single) (02/13 update)
阻碍.
你收到这如梦似真消息
我们来自1999年
你收到这消息是为了改变你目睹的事件
我们的科技技术尚未达到能制造一个够先进到足以左右你的意识状态的程度
但这不是在作梦
你正看到什么是实际上在逆天而行的目的下所发生后果....
公园下
那里是疯子碰头的地方
机械般的玩着"kill-by-number"的游戏
和一个叫"5"的朋友在公园下
我在一场车祸事故中或是在战争中..
但我不曾十分相似过呀!
小小的善意谎言如:"我在那里"
来去巫毒教的地盘用餐
就如这是一日所造就的(规模)
你可以观赏人类试着逃跑的模样
Oh!瞧这个,这有一台强暴专用的机器
假如他不稀罕,我就要出去外头了
你会不敢相信他们干的好事
我们不是爱人,我们不够浪漫
我们在这服务你
公园下
那里的歌是"death, death"
直到太阳哭吊早晨
和我的朋友们在公园下
我们不是爱人,我们不够浪漫
我们在这服务你
换汤不换药(不同的人说着同样的话)
我们不是爱人,我们不够浪漫
我们在这服务你.......

Interference.
You are receiving this broadcast as a dream.
We are transmitting from the year 1 9 9 9.
You are receiving this broadcast in order to alter the events you are seeing.
Our technology has not developed a transmitter strong enough to reach your conscious state of awareness.
But this is not a dream.
You are seeing what is actually occurring for the purpose of causality violation
Down in the park
Where the madmen meet
The machines play "kill-by-number"
Down in the park with a friend called "five"
I was in a car crash
Or was it the war
But I've never been quite the same
Little white lies like "I was there"
Come to zom-zom's a place to eat
Like it was built in one day
You can watch the humans trying to run
Oh look there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if he'd look the other way
You wouldn't believe the things they do
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you
Down to the park
Where the chant is "death, death"
Until the sun cries morning
Down in the park with friends of mine
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you
A different face but the words never change
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you
We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you

HIGHWAY TO HELL 地狱捷径 (From "Detroit Rock City"-Soundtrack) (02/13 update)
自由自在生活
一张远程车票
一无所求,遗世独立
曾经我眼皆我有
不需理由,不需造作
无牵无挂
放下吧!派对时间(到了)
我的朋友们也将会在那儿
我在驶往地狱的高速公路上,我在驶往地狱的高速公路上......
没有暂停标志和速限
没有人能让我慢下来
就像轮子一样,不停的转动着
没有人会招待我吃一顿
我是撒旦,我自己买单
我在一个摇滚乐团里演唱着
Hey!妈咪,看着我
我正在前往极乐之土的路上
我在驶往地狱的高速公路上,我在驶往地狱的高速公路上......

Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
I am Satan, payed my dues
I'm playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

GOLDEN YEARS 黄金岁月(from the "Dead Man On Campus"-Soundtrack) (02/13 update)
黄金岁月,金色痛击........
别让我听到你说的话
生命让你无处可躲,天使
来叫醒我的宝贝
看那天空,生命开始了
夜晚是温暖的,白天是朝气蓬勃的
来叫醒我的宝贝
我的宝贝他失去了这一切
一但我求你拯救她幼小的心灵
黄金岁月,(将成为)金色痛击........
来叫醒我的宝贝
昨晚他们爱着你
敞开大门,拉着绳索,天使
来叫醒我的宝贝
走在运气上,你还有足够的时间
绝对不要走马看花,左顾右盼
来叫醒我的宝贝
我将会与你相守相随一千年,宝贝
在这些黄金岁月里,没有任何事会干扰你
黄金岁月,(将成为)金色痛击........
来叫醒我的宝贝
这些日子,不会太久了
(我)将(带你)回到真正属于你的地方
在一台20呎长的梦幻轿车后
别哭我的甜心,别让我心疼
一切都会没事的,但你将会得到智慧
走向希望,走向希望,一天一天.....
我相信上帝啊!!
我信所有之道
来叫醒我的宝贝

Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Last night they loved you,
opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
Come get up my baby
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe oh lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby

Working Class Hero 蓝领英雄 (03/017/2001 update)
当你一生下来,他们让你觉得自己很渺小
让你顿时无所适从
那么剧烈的痛楚,你却毫无感觉
蓝领英雄必须受到尊重,蓝领英雄必须受到尊重
他们在家伤害你,他们在学校打压你
假如你聪明伶俐使他们相形见拙,他们会憎恨你
你简直疯狂透顶, 你不能任他们摆布呀!
蓝领英雄必须受到尊重,蓝领英雄必须受到尊重
当他们对你20几年来的施暴恐吓后
他们会打量你选择的职业(身份)
但你是无法在充满恐惧下还施展你的工作能力
蓝领英雄必须受到尊重,蓝领英雄必须受到尊重
他们持续用宗教,性爱和电视来麻醉你(的感官)
你认为你是如此聪明,且自由自在
(其实)你是他妈的没用的弱势族群!
蓝领英雄必须受到尊重,蓝领英雄必须受到尊重
那有另一个更好的发展空间,他们却要你按兵不动
首先你必须学会如何笑里藏刀
(如果)你想要成为像站在高处的那群人
蓝领英雄必须受到尊重,蓝领英雄必须受到尊重
如果你想成为英雄的话,那就跟随我吧!
如果你想成为英雄的话,那就跟随我吧!

As soon as you're born they make you feel small
Givin' you no time 'sted of it all
The pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero it's something to be
A working class hero it's something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at schoool
They hate you if you're clever and they dispise a fool
You're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero it's something to be
A working class hero it's something to be
When they tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
But you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero it's something to be
A working class hero it's something to be
They keep you doped with religion, and sex and T.V.
You think you're so clever and class-less and free
You're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero it's something to be
A working class hero it's something to be
There's room at the top they are tellin' you still
First you must learn how to smile as you kill
You wanna be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero it's something to be
A working class hero it's something to be
You wanna be a hero then just follow me
You wanna be a hero then just follow me

Diamonds and Pollen 钻石与花粉 (03/017/2001 update)
美国压榨至极
电力和怀孕
奢华浪女和火神崇拜
狼吞虎咽着真理
我们就像一群穿衣带冠的猴子
我们是金色针头
钻石与花粉以及昏厥的白人
一个沮丧的迷你皇后
死星的脸庞
濒临绝境的困顿
她在床上是如此的温柔
那石榴树的土地沉陷消失
颤抖的人啊!
恐惧的人啊!
苦难的人啊!
呕吐的人啊!
需求的人啊!
颤抖的人啊!
恐惧的人啊!
苦难的人啊!
呕吐的人啊!
需求的人啊!
一百万个伤口,一百万份承诺
你们悲哀的结局是种植在他们的花园
他们等待如花朵般的花开花谢
你们悲哀的结局是种植在他们的花园
他们等待如花朵般的花开花谢...........

America bled to death
Electric and pregnant
Brilliant sluts and fire worship
Devouring the righteous
We were just monkeys braiding thread
We were golden needles
Diamonds and pollen
And Coma White
A manniqueen of depression
The face of the dead star
Fagged out for the corner
She ws so soft in the bed
And the pomegranet earth spins into oblivion
The one that trembles
The one that fears
The one that suffers
The one that vomits
The one that needs
The one that trembles
The one that fears
The one that suffers
The one that vomits
The one that needs
A million scars, a million promises (Repeat 6x)
And all your sad endings are planting in their gardens
And they're waiting to grow and to die like flowers do
And all your sad endings are planting in their gardens
And they're waiting to grow and to die like flowers do
And all your sad endings are planting in their gardens
And they're waiting to grow and to die like flowers do

你们的时代已经过去,宝贝
夜晚降临
夜影罩上了这些年

试图告知我没人真他妈的能瞭解
用你的时间(生命)去交易那些微的硬币(代价)
在我们的全盛时期,成功在望,宝贝,
再一次同心协力............

Gonna make it, baby, if we try
Come over here
The old get older and the young get stronger
May take a week and it may take longer
They got the guns, but we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah, we're taking over
Come on over, yeah
Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening crawl across the years
You walk across the floor with flowers in your hands
Trying to tell me no one fucking understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it baby in our prime
Get together one more time (Repeat 8x)
I wanna fuck you, mother I wanna fuck you, mother
Fuck you
Get together one more time (Repeat 6x)
Fuck you, mother

Astonishing Panorama Of The Endtimes 惊骇末世景观 (02/07/2001 update)
那男孩有一颗像原子弹的头
在十字架前吊死了他,如同神的第一个儿子
他早已等待多时,就等着这一切(到来)
那男孩是15(岁?),但看起来有16(岁?)
渴望自耶稣的牢笼里解放出来
他早已经撕下最后一页,"最后的怒吼"那页.....
暴力是为了人们,他们总是啃食着流血的手
暴力是为了人们,去找些他们需要的孩子们来
杀死你的神,杀死你的神,杀死你的电视机....
男孩被怠慢的神们洗涤了罪恶
如同天意般的烧毁他的十字架
他言不及义的说着话,像是颗傀儡的头
暴力是为了人们,他们总是啃食着流血的手
暴力是为了人们,去找些他们需要的孩子们来
这是你该去畏惧的......

The boy's got a head like an atom bomb
Hang him from a cross like the number one son
And he's been waiting so long
To get it on
The boy is 15 but he's 16 gauge
Wants to break out from his Jesus cage
He's already torn out the last page
It's the "latest rage"
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need
Kill your god, Kill your god
Kill your TV
The boy's purified by the quitter gods
Burning up his cross like a revelation
And his glass jaw opens
Like a puppet head
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need

this is what you should fear you are what you should fear......
