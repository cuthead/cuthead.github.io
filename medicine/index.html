过敏性鼻炎是发生在鼻粘膜的变态反应，也是呼吸道变态反应常见的表现形式，有时和支气管哮喘同时存在。变应性鼻炎是一种由基因与环境互相作用而诱发的多因素疾病。冷水洗鼻法：每天早上起床后用凉水一盆，把整个鼻子浸入水中稍吸气，使水进入鼻腔根鼻黏膜充分接触，注意不要用力过猛水。此法需长期坚持效果十分显著，旨在提高鼻黏膜的适应能力，尤其对季节和温度变化引起的过敏鼻烟极其有效果，而且可以有效提高感冒的免疫力，尽量少吃鱼类、肉类，以免上火引起鼻炎。花生不去衣，45克，粳米100克，同煮为粥，加冰糖适量，食用。本方具有补脾胃、去湿邪的功效。适用过敏性鼻炎脾胃虚弱。大枣具有抗过敏作用，每日10枚，煮水饮服，久用也有疗效。

By itself, carbonated water appears to have little impact on health.[1] While carbonated water is somewhat acidic, this acidity is quickly neutralized by saliva.[2]
Carbonated water may increase irritable bowel syndrome symptoms of bloating and gas due to the release of carbon dioxide in the digestive tract.[3] It does not appear to have an effect on GERD.[4] There is tentative evidence that carbonated water may help with constipation among people who have had a stroke.[5] Some carbonated waters have added sodium, so they may be an issue for those on low-sodium diets.
Typical carbonated soft drinks such as colas do have health risks. Carbonated colas have a correlation with slightly decreased bone density in older women. Soft drinks are about 100 times more erosive to teeth than plain carbonated water.[3]
