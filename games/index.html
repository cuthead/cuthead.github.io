pes 2010 is the best game i have ever played.and there is no pes 2010 on steam so i download reloaded pes 2010.seems like reloaded removed online verify cdkey and online play.the game set up rar file can't be extracted by 7zip,but it can be extracted by winrar.cod 6 and cs:go is also great games but need gtx 650 ti boost to run 60 fps,on gtx 260+ and gt 740 those two game only run on 30 fps.and xbox 360 wired controller and razer deathadder and razer cynosa is the best for gaming.razer cynosa fn+f10 enter game mode doesn't fix 6 key conflict,but i can't press both f1 f2 f3 at the same time in fofix,so i change the key from f1-f5 to 1-5 and it works.

it all began in ninety-four. kept on rollin' in ninety-five.the pieces fell in place in ninety-six and it came to the end in ninety-seven. but now it comes, and here we go! k.o.f is here again! nothing's gonna stop because it's nineteen ninety-eight!

when your net, zone, everything comes effortless, game slows down, basically let your instincts take over. i think it's something you could definitely train yourself into you.

you don’t wanna be lebron james. i can inspire you, impress you, make you believe, but i am just one man.
nothing about my game is great yet. i still have work to do.
more challenges to face. much more to learn, to be as good as i can be,
but i do see the light, and it is up to me to go and get it.
i am lebron james, you don’t wanna be me, you wanna be better than me.

farah: we all make mistakes, prince. the difference is that you have accepted
yours. i saw what you did at the workshop; and what the old man said is true.
you are a prince.
prince, there's still something i don't understand... how did you really know my name?
listen to this:[reading] "love is life, so if you want to live, die in love, die in love if you want to stay alive.
seven years? what are you talking about?
most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. but i have seen the face of time, and i can tell you: they are wrong. time is an ocean in a storm. you may wonder who i am or why i say this. sit down and i will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard. [first and last lines in the trilogy].

Forever Young - Demo

Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait
We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best
But expecting the worst
Would you please to drop the bomb on us?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We got no power
But we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine how we won the war?
Little fascist lady she loves you so
Following her leader
She's getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young

Someone's like water
Someone's like heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
They say that youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
Why can't I sleep while I'm thinking of you
The blood is up and burning
