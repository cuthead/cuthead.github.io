I burn debian 8.7.0 disk1 to philip dvd-r successful,dd if=/dev/disk1 of=~/2.iso got different md5 when linux dd if=/dev/cdrom of=~/2.iso has same md5 and diskutil cdr is the same as iso same md5 as offical,boot debian successful,though os x can not read debian dvd.when diskutil burn debian 8.6.0 disk2 to chinese dvd-r,diskutil prompt fail,but I do not have official md5 so I do not know if it is really fail.I use dd and diskutil and k3b to burn iso and file and backup iso and file.
I burned some PS2 game DVD and PC game DVD,I cloned cdr(iso) from DVD ROM,I hashed cdr(iso) from DVD ROM,I find some old PS2 game DVD and PC game DVD ed2k I can not find on internet.I find another recent some PS2 game DVD and PC game DVD ed2k I can find on internet.
xunlei downloading file name is the origin http url file name.
baidu pan interrupt downloading file will cause bad file ed2k,baidu pan with constant downloading file will cause good file ed2k.
